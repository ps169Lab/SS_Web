            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Where is Peru Located?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru is a country in South America. It sits next to the Pacific Ocean. Peru has neighbors: Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, and Chile to the south. It has a long coastline along the ocean.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peru is a big country. The highest mountain in Peru is Huascarán Sur. It is very tall! The lowest point is the Bayóvar Depression, which goes below sea level.
            </p>

            <!-- Three Regions Section -->
            <h2>The Three Regions of Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Andes Mountains split Peru into three different regions. Each region is special in its own way.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Coast (Costa)</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Coast is a narrow, mostly dry strip of land next to the Pacific Ocean. It has valleys made by rivers. This area is not too hot or too cold. The north part is warmer and gets more rain. The ocean gives Peru many fish and other sea animals.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Highlands (Sierra)</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Highlands are in the Andes mountains. This area gets a lot of rain in summer. It gets colder as you go up the mountains, all the way to the snowy tops. The mountains are close to the coast and block clouds, which is why the coast gets very little rain.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Amazon Jungle (Selva)</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Amazon Jungle is a big, flat area covered by rainforest that goes east. This part makes up about 60% of Peru. Peru has one of the biggest rainforests in the world. The jungle gets a lot of rain and is very hot, except for the south part, which has cold winters.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Climate Section -->
            <h2>Peru's Diverse Climate</h2>
            
            <p>
                Even though Peru is near the equator, it has many different kinds of weather. This is because of its location, mountains, land shape, and ocean currents. Peru has 84 of the world's 104 climate zones!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The land in Peru goes from below sea level to very high mountains. This helps create many different climates. The three main regions have three main types of weather:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The coast is not too hot or cold, gets little rain, and feels damp.</li>
                <li>The mountains get lots of rain in summer and get colder as you go up.</li>
                <li>The Amazon jungle is hot and rainy, except for the south part.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Natural Resources Section -->
            <h2>Natural Resources</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru has many natural resources. It has metals like copper, silver, and gold. It also has oil, wood, fish, and water power. Peru's different land types give it many resources that have been important for a long time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peru sometimes has earthquakes, big waves, floods, and landslides. These happen because Peru sits where two big pieces of the Earth's crust meet.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Fun Facts Section -->
            <h2>Fun Facts About Peru's Geography</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Lake Titicaca is the biggest lake in South America. Boats can sail on it even though it's high in the mountains.</li>
                <li>The Amazon River starts in Peru. It is one of the longest rivers in the world.</li>
                <li>Peru has 4% of all the fresh water on Earth.</li>
                <li>Machu Picchu, a famous old Inca city, sits high on a mountain.</li>
                <li>The potato first came from Peru many thousands of years ago.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Population Section -->
            <h2>Where People Live in Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                Where people live in Peru depends on the land. About 59% of people live on the coast, 27% in the mountains, and 14% in the jungle. Most people live in cities, especially on the coast where Lima, the capital city, is.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over time, people have learned to live in Peru's different lands. Old groups like the Moche and Nazca made steps on hills to grow food and built water systems in dry areas. The Incas built steps on mountains to grow food and made long roads to connect their big empire.
