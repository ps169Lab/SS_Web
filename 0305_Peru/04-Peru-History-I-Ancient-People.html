            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>The Earliest People of Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                People have lived in Peru for over 15,000 years. The oldest signs of people in Peru go back to about 12,500 BCE at a place called Huaca Prieta. Some findings show people may have been there even earlier, around 14,000 years ago.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first people hunted animals and gathered plants for food. Around 7000 BCE, they started to live in one place and not move around. They began to grow plants like gourds and cotton. They used cotton to make fishing nets.

            <!-- Early Civilizations Section -->
            <h2>The Rise of Early Civilizations</h2>
            
            <p>
                Around 3000 BCE (which was 5,000 years ago), bigger groups of people started to form in Peru. People on the coast got a lot of food from the sea. They learned how to spin and knit cotton and wool. They also learned to work with metals like gold. All of these things made it easier for them to survive. More people were born and the population (the amount of people living there) started to grow a lot. </p>
            
            <h3>The Norte Chico Civilization</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Norte Chico people lived on Peru's coast from 3000 to 1800 BCE. They were the oldest advanced society in the Americas. They built big temples and pyramids in the Supe Valley, including "Buena Vista" or "The Temple of the Fox", which was a giant temple they used to look at the stars in the sky at night. </p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/seturismo.pe/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sechin-bajo-ancash.jpg?resize=604%2C405&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <h3>The Chavin People</h3><p>The Chavin People built stone temples and made art showing jaguars, eagles, and snakes. They learned new ways to use their environment and create their culture. They made pottery and built mud-brick pyramids. They made the Nazca Lines that we saw earlier. And they built houses and other buildings with stone from the Andes Mountains. </p><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aFajfsv2o6k/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>Soon they built themselves up to an empire, called The Wari Empire. They built long roads, stone buildings, and steps on mountains for growing food. The Inca would later use many of these ideas.</p>
            
            <!-- The Inca Empire Section -->
            <h2>The Inca Empire</h2>
            
            <p>
                The last and most famous old group in Peru was the Inca Empire. They ruled from about 1438 to 1532 CE. When the Spanish came, the Inca Empire was the biggest and most advanced in all of the Americas.

            <h3>Origin and Growth</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca started in the Andes mountains in the early 1200s. The empire grew to an area that covered of most of the Andes Mountains, from Ecuador to Chile. The Inca Empire was called Tawantinsuyu which means "The Land of the Four Parts". The empire had four regions. The capital city of Cusco was in the middle where all four regions met. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/95/200095-050-73658638/Inca-emperor-Pachacuti-Inca-Yupanqui.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p><ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inca Achievements</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca did many amazing things:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>They built a big network of roads called the Inca Trail</li>
                <li>They made steps on steep mountains to grow food</li>
                <li>They built amazing stone buildings like Machu Picchu without using cement</li>
                <li>They kept records using knotted strings called quipus</li>
                <li>They ran a huge empire without writing or wheels</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inca Society and Culture</h3>
            
            <p>
                Inca society was very organized. At the top was the Emperor. People thought he was the son of the sun god Inti (just like how the Chinese had the "Mandate of Heavan"). Many different groups with different languages lived in the empire, but Quechua was the main language.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Inca Empire, only royal children and sons of chiefs went to school where learned math and astronomy (the study of stars and space), which helped with farming. Regular people did not go to school. They learned skills needed for the empire, like pottery and farming. </p><p><img src="https://cloud.educaplay.com/recursos/227/7278179/imagen_1_1602908783.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>
                The Inca did not use money. Instead, people traded things and worked for the empire. Most people paid taxes by working. This work was called mit'a. In return, the empire kept people safe, gave food during hard times, and built water systems and farm terraces.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The End of the Inca Empire</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca Empire got weaker because of a fight between two brothers named Huascar and Atahualpa. They fought from 1529 to 1532. During this time, soldiers from Spain sailed across the ocean and came into Peru. Even though they had fewer men, the Spanish caught and killed Atahualpa. This caused big problems for the empire. By 1572, the Spanish had taken over all Inca lands.
            </p><p><img src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/james-edwin-mcconnell-conquistadors-inca-empire-painting.jpg?width=894&amp;quality=55" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>
                The old groups of Peru, ending with the Inca Empire, left behind a rich culture that still shapes Peru today. The things they built, the ways they grew food, their art, and how they organized their people show how culture, history, and land worked together to make these amazing communities.
