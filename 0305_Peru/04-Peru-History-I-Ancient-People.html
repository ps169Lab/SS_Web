            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>The Earliest People of Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                People have lived in Peru for over 15,000 years. The oldest signs of people in Peru go back to about 12,500 BCE at a place called Huaca Prieta. Some findings show people may have been there even earlier, around 14,000 years ago.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first people hunted animals and gathered plants for food. Around 7000 BCE, they started to live in one place and not move around. They began to grow plants like gourds and cotton. They used cotton to make fishing nets.

            <!-- Early Civilizations Section -->
            <h2>The Rise of Early Civilizations</h2>
            
            <p>
                Around 3000 BCE, bigger groups of people started to form in Peru. People on the coast got a lot of food from the sea. They learned how to spin and knit cotton and wool. They also learned to work with metals like gold.</p>
            
            <h3>The Norte Chico Civilization</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Norte Chico people lived on Peru's coast from 3000 to 1800 BCE. They were the oldest advanced society in the Americas. They built big temples and pyramids in the Supe Valley.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The oldest monument in Peru is at Sechin Bajo, from 3600 BCE. Other old sites include El Paraíso and Buena Vista, which was used to look at stars 4200 years ago.

            <!-- Major Pre-Inca Cultures Section -->
            <h2>Major Pre-Inca Cultures</h2>
            
            <p>
                After these early people, many other groups lived in Peru's coastal and mountain areas. These groups lived during different time periods:</p>
            
            <p>
                The earliest people  built stone temples and made art showing jaguars, eagles, and snakes. These people, called The Chavín influenced many other groups in Peru. As time went on the people of Peru learned new ways to use their environment and create their culture. They made pottery and built mud-brick pyramids. They made the Nazca Lines that we saw earlier. And they built houses and other buildings with stone from the Andes Mountains. </p>
            
            <p>Soon they built themselves up to an empire, called The Wari Empire. They built long roads, stone buildings, and steps on mountains for growing food. The Inca would later use many of these ideas.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Late Intermediate (1000 CE – 1476 CE)</h3>
            
            <p>
                After the Wari Empire ended, local groups grew strong again. The most powerful was the Chimú Kingdom on the north coast. Their capital was Chan Chan, the biggest mud-brick city in the world. Later, the Inca would conquer the Chimú.
            </p>
            
            <!-- The Inca Empire Section -->
            <h2>The Inca Empire</h2>
            
            <p>
                The last and most famous old group in Peru was the Inca Empire. They ruled from about 1438 to 1532 CE. When the Spanish came, the Inca Empire was the biggest and most advanced in all of the Americas.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Origin and Growth</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca started in the Peruvian highlands in the early 1200s. The empire grew slowly at first. Then it grew quickly under Emperor Pachacuti in the mid-1400s. Under Pachacuti and his son, the Incas took control of most of the Andes, from Ecuador to Chile.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tawantinsuyu: The Realm of Four Parts</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca Empire was called Tawantinsuyu. This means "Land of the Four Parts" in the Quechua language. The empire had four regions. The capital city of Cusco was in the middle where all four regions met. The four regions were:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Chinchaysuyu (northwest)</li>
                <li>Antisuyu (northeast)</li>
                <li>Kuntisuyu (southwest)</li>
                <li>Qullasuyu (southeast)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inca Achievements</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca did many amazing things:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>They built a big network of roads called the Inca Trail, over 30,000 kilometers long</li>
                <li>They made steps on steep mountains to grow food</li>
                <li>They built amazing stone buildings like Machu Picchu without using cement</li>
                <li>They kept records using knotted strings called quipus</li>
                <li>They ran a huge empire without writing or wheels</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inca Society and Culture</h3>
            
            <p>
                Inca society was very organized. At the top was the Sapa Inca (Emperor). People thought he was the son of the sun god Inti. Many different groups with different languages lived in the empire, but Quechua was the main language.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Inca Empire, only royal children and sons of chiefs went to school. They had teachers called Amautas. They learned math and astronomy, which helped with farming. Regular people learned trades and skills needed for the empire.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Inca did not use money. Instead, people traded things and worked for the empire. Most people paid taxes by working. This work was called mit'a. In return, the empire kept people safe, gave food during hard times, and built water systems and farm terraces.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The End of the Inca Empire</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Inca Empire got weaker because of a fight between brothers Huascar and Atahualpa from 1529 to 1532. During this time, Spanish soldiers led by Francisco Pizarro came to Peru. Even though they had fewer men, the Spanish caught and killed Atahualpa. This caused big problems for the empire. By 1572, the Spanish had taken over all Inca lands.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The old groups of Peru, ending with the Inca Empire, left behind a rich culture that still shapes Peru today. The things they built, the ways they grew food, their art, and how they organized their people show how culture, history, and land worked together to make these amazing communities.
