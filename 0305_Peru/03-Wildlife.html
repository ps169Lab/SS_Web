            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Peru: A Megadiverse Country</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru is a megadiverse country. This means it has lots and lots of different plants and animals. Peru has 84 of the world's 104 climate zones. This makes many different homes for wildlife. Peru has over 21,000 kinds of plants and animals. Many of these can only be found in Peru and nowhere else.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peru has three main regions - the Coast, the Highlands, and the Amazon Jungle. In each place, plants and animals have special features that help them live there.
            </p>

            <!-- Wildlife in the Coast Region -->
            <h2>Wildlife in the Coast Region</h2>
            
            <p>
                The coast of Peru is mostly desert, but it's not empty. The Pacific Ocean next to Peru has many fish and sea animals. This is because of a cold current called the Humboldt Current that brings food for sea life.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Animal Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                Animals along the coast have adapted to survive in this unique environment:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Sea lions have thick fat to stay warm in cold water</li>
                <li>Birds like pelicans have special beaks to catch fish</li>
                <li>Small fish swim in big groups to stay safe</li>
                <li>Crabs and shellfish have hard shells to protect them</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Plant Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                Plants in the coastal desert have also developed special adaptations:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cacti keep water in their thick stems</li>
                <li>Some plants have long roots to find water deep in the ground</li>
                <li>Some plants can get water from fog in the air</li>
                <li>Some trees can grow in salty water</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Wildlife in the Highlands Region -->
            <h2>Wildlife in the Highlands Region</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Highlands region has the Andes Mountains. It's hard for plants and animals to live here. As you go up the mountains, it gets colder, there's less air to breathe, and the sun is stronger. Plants and animals have special ways to live in these tough conditions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Animal Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                Highland animals have evolved special features to thrive at high altitudes:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Animals like llamas and alpacas have special blood that can carry more oxygen</li>
                <li>The Andean condor has very big wings to help it fly on mountain air</li>
                <li>The spectacled bear has thick fur to stay warm</li>
                <li>Guinea pigs have small, round bodies that keep heat in</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Plant Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                Plants in the Highlands have also developed unique adaptations:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Puya raimondii plant can live even when it's freezing</li>
                <li>Ichu grass has tough leaves that can handle cold and dry weather</li>
                <li>Many mountain plants grow low to the ground to stay out of strong winds</li>
                <li>Some plants grow in tight, pillow-like shapes to keep warm</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Wildlife in the Amazon Jungle Region -->
            <h2>Wildlife in the Amazon Jungle Region</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Amazon Jungle in Peru has more kinds of plants and animals than almost anywhere else. This rainforest gets lots of rain and is very hot and damp. These conditions are perfect for many living things.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Animal Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Amazon's animals have adapted to life in the dense rainforest:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Jaguars have spots that help them hide in the forest</li>
                <li>Toucans have big, light beaks to reach fruit on thin branches</li>
                <li>Poison dart frogs are bright colors to warn other animals they are dangerous</li>
                <li>The paiche, a very big fish, can breathe air</li>
                <li>Monkeys have tails that can grab onto branches like a hand</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Plant Adaptations</h3>
            
            <p>
                Plants in the Amazon have evolved to compete for sunlight and survive in the wet environment:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Many trees grow very tall to get sunlight</li>
                <li>Some plants grow on other plants to get light without touching the ground</li>
                <li>Many plants have waxy leaves that keep water off</li>
                <li>Some plants work with ants to stay safe</li>
                <li>Vines climb up trees to reach the sun</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Fun Facts Section -->
            <h2>Amazing Wildlife Facts</h2>
            
            <ul>

            <p>
                Peru has so many different plants and animals. They have changed over thousands of years to live in different places. Each kind has special ways to survive where it lives. Peru's different lands have made it possible for all these plants and animals to live and grow.
