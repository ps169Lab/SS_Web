            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Peru's Three Climate Regions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru has three main climate regions: the Coast, the Highlands, and the Amazon Jungle. In each region, plants and animals have special adaptations to help them survive. Let's learn about three amazing examples: pelicans, alpacas, and ichu grass!
            </p>
            
            <!-- Image placeholder -->
            <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Wildlife of Peru showing pelicans, alpacas, and ichu grass">
            
            <!-- Pelican Adaptations -->
            <h2>Pelican Adaptations on the Coast</h2>
            
            <p>
                Pelicans live along Peru's Pacific Coast. They have amazing adaptations to help them catch fish and survive by the ocean.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Pelicans have huge pouches under their beaks that can hold up to 3 gallons of water and fish!</li>
                <li>Their special throat pouches stretch like rubber bands to scoop up fish.</li>
                <li>Pelicans have waterproof feathers that keep them dry when diving into water.</li>
                <li>They have webbed feet that help them swim and take off from water.</li>
                <li>Pelicans have excellent eyesight to spot fish from high in the air.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Alpaca Adaptations -->
            <h2>Alpaca Adaptations in the Highlands</h2>
            
            <p>
                Alpacas live in the Andes Mountains of Peru. They have special adaptations to survive in cold, high places where there isn't much oxygen.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Alpacas have thick, warm wool that keeps them cozy in freezing temperatures.</li>
                <li>Their blood can carry more oxygen than other animals, helping them live high in the mountains.</li>
                <li>Alpacas have special padded feet that don't damage the ground when they walk.</li>
                <li>They have long necks to reach grass without bending down in the snow.</li>
                <li>Alpacas can go a long time without water, which helps in dry mountain areas.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Ichu Grass Adaptations -->
            <h2>Ichu Grass Adaptations in the Highlands</h2>
            
            <p>
                Ichu grass grows in the high Andes Mountains. It has special adaptations to survive harsh mountain weather.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Ichu grass has tough, narrow leaves that don't break in strong winds.</li>
                <li>It grows in tight clumps to trap heat and stay warm.</li>
                <li>The grass has deep roots to find water in dry mountain soil.</li>
                <li>Ichu grass can survive freezing temperatures that would kill other plants.</li>
                <li>Its silvery color reflects sunlight to protect it from strong mountain sun.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2>People and Wildlife in Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                Just like plants and animals, people in Peru have adapted to live in different regions. In the mountains, people use alpaca wool to make warm clothes. They also use ichu grass to build roofs for their homes. Along the coast, people catch fish like pelicans do, but with boats and nets instead of beaks!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The special places where plants and animals live help decide where people build their homes too. People learn from wildlife and find ways to live in all of Peru's different regions.
            </p>
