            <h2>Amazing Places in Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru has many special places. It has colorful mountains and strange lines in the desert. It has busy cities and quiet lakes. Let's look at some amazing places in Peru.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Rainbow Mountain Section -->
            <h2>Vinicunca: The Rainbow Mountain</h2>
            
            <p>
                Vinicunca is also called Rainbow Mountain. It is one of Peru's most amazing sights. It sits in the Cusco area high up in the mountains. This mountain has colorful stripes that look like a rainbow painted on the land.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mountain's colors come from different minerals in the dirt. For a long time, these colors were hidden under ice and snow. But the snow has melted, showing the rainbow colors underneath. Many people visit Rainbow Mountain now.
            </p>

            <!-- Nazca Lines Section -->
            <h2>The Mysterious Nazca Lines</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Nazca Lines are big pictures drawn on the ground in the Nazca Desert. They are a big mystery. There are over 700 of these pictures covering a large area.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People made these lines a long time ago, between 500 BC and 500 AD. They moved the top red-brown rocks to show the yellow-gray dirt underneath. The dry weather with no wind has kept these lines safe for a very long time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Nazca Lines show simple lines, shapes, and animals. There are more than 70 animal pictures like a hummingbird, spider, monkey, and whale. Some are very big - the condor is 134 meters long! You can see some lines from hills, but the best way to see them is from the air.
