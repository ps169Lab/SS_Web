            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>The Spanish Arrival in Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Colonial Period in Peru started when Spanish soldiers came in the early 1500s. This time lasted from about 1532 to 1824. It came after the time of the Inca Empire and before Peru became free.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spanish soldiers led by Francisco Pizarro first came to Inca lands in 1526. After another trip in 1529, Pizarro went to Spain. The Queen of Spain said he could take over the Inca lands. Pizarro became the boss of all the land the Spanish called Peru, or New Castile.
            </p>

            <!-- Spanish Conquest Section -->
            <h2>The Spanish Conquest</h2>
            
            <p>
                When the Spanish came to Peru, the Inca Empire was already weak. Two brothers, Huascar and Atahualpa, were fighting each other. Pizarro had only about 168 men, but they caught Emperor Atahualpa in November 1532 at Cajamarca. The Inca army was much bigger, but they still lost.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Inca gave the Spanish lots of gold and silver to free Atahualpa. But the Spanish killed him anyway in July 1533. This caused big problems for the empire. The Spanish then went to Cusco, the Inca capital. They put in a ruler who would do what they said. The Inca tried to fight back, but the Spanish took over.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The name "Peru" might have come from "Birú," the name of a local leader near Panama that Spanish explorers met. Spain officially used the name in 1529.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Establishment of the Viceroyalty Section -->
            <h2>The Viceroyalty of Peru</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 1542, Spain created the Viceroyalty of Peru. At first, it included most of Spanish South America. Lima, started by Pizarro on January 18, 1535, as the "City of Kings," became the capital of the new viceroyalty.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The viceroyalty was not well organized until Viceroy Francisco Álvarez de Toledo came in 1572. Toledo traveled around the region and made many important changes. People say he was "one of the great administrators of human times."
            </p>
            
            <h3>Government and Administration</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Viceroyalty of Peru was run by a viceroy, who stood for the Spanish king or queen. The government was based in Lima and had different levels:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Viceroy was the top boss</li>
                <li>Audiencias were courts that also helped run things</li>
                <li>Governorates were smaller areas run by governors</li>
                <li>Captaincies General were groups of provinces that needed military protection</li>
                <li>Local areas were run by a corregidor or a town council</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Life in the Colony Section -->
            <h2>Life in the Spanish Colony</h2>
            
            <h3>Economy</h3>
            
            <p>
                Spain created the Viceroyalty of Peru partly to get the riches of South America. Gold and silver from the Andes made the conquerors rich. The viceroyalty was the main source of Spanish wealth in South America.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The economy was based on controlling trade and getting minerals, mostly silver from Potosí. Viceroy Toledo made mining bigger by using the mita system. This was a way to make local people work in the mines. It came from Inca times. Spanish officials made native communities send workers to the mines.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gold and silver went through Lima on trade routes to Spain through Panama, and to Mexico and the Philippines across the Pacific Ocean. Most silver went to Europe, but some stayed in South America. It paid for things like the Spanish army in Chile.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Society and Culture</h3>
            
            <p>
                Lima grew into a powerful and fancy colonial capital. By the 1700s, it was the main Spanish city in the Americas. Peruvian society was run by criollos (people born in the Americas whose parents came from Spain).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first college in the Americas was the National University of San Marcos in Lima, started in 1551. Viceroys helped education by making the university better and starting medical schools.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Books and stories in the viceroyalty mixed native spoken stories with Spanish writing. Early writing included history books and religious works. Some writers were Spanish soldiers and officials. Others were native or mestizo (mixed Spanish and native) writers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Native writers, often from royal Inca families, like Titu Cusi Yupanqui and Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala, wrote about their history, stories, and what they thought about Spanish rule. Guamán Poma de Ayala wrote a long letter to the King of Spain saying what was wrong with the colonial system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Art and culture grew during this time. Woven art mixed native and Chinese pictures. The Cuzco School made its own art style, mixing European and native ideas.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Challenges and Resistance Section -->
            <h2>Challenges and Resistance</h2>
            
            <p>
                Even though it gave Spain lots of wealth, the Viceroyalty had many problems. During the 1700s, the Spanish didn't fully control the provinces. They depended on local leaders (Curacas) who were proud of their Inca past.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Native people fought against Spanish rule many times. Big rebellions included:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Juan Santos Atahualpa's fight in 1742 in the Andean jungle</li>
                <li>Túpac Amaru II's rebellion in 1780 near Cuzco, which was the biggest native uprising in colonial times</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Money problems grew in the 1700s. Silver mining went down. Spain created new viceroyalties that took away some of Peru's land. The Bourbon Reforms raised taxes and split up the viceroyalty. These problems made the Viceroyalty of Peru get weaker.
            </p>
            
            <!-- End of the Colonial Period Section -->
            <h2>End of the Colonial Period</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 1808, Napoleon invaded Spain. This led to freedom movements all over Spanish America. Some criollos rebelled in Peru, but most stayed loyal to Spain. This made Peru the last place Spain still controlled in South America.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the freedom wars, Viceroy José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa made armies to stop rebellions and protect Peru. It became Spain's last stronghold. But freedom fighters led by José de San Martín finally decided to attack Peru directly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peru said it was free in 1821. But it only became fully free after the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. On December 30, 1824, the Viceroyalty of Peru officially ended. This ended almost 300 years of Spanish rule.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The colonial time changed Peru a lot. It shaped how people live, their culture, money, and politics. The mix of Spanish and native ways made a special Peruvian identity that still grows today. We can still see how this time affected Peru's buildings, language, religion, and society.
