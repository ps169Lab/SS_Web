            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
                Just like the United States has a government, New York State has its own government too. The New York State government makes decisions and laws that affect people living in New York. This document will explain how New York's government is structured and how it is similar to and different from the federal government.</p><!-- The Three Branches -->
            <h2>THE THREE BRANCHES</h2>
            <p>
                Like the federal government, New York State's government has three branches:
            </p>
            <img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/new-york-govt-flowchartfix3320x4400png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /><!-- The Legislative Branch -->
            <h3>THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH</h3>
            <p>
                The Legislative Branch makes laws for New York State. It is called the New York State Legislature and has two parts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The State Senate</strong>: This is like the U.S. Senate, but it has 63 members who represent different parts of New York State.</li>
                <li><strong>The State Assembly</strong>: This is like the U.S. House of Representatives, but it has 150 members. Each member represents a district in New York State.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together, the Senate and Assembly discuss and vote on bills (proposed laws). If both houses pass a bill, it goes to the Governor.
            </p>

            <h3>THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH</h3>
            <p>
                The Executive Branch carries out and enforces the laws. The head of this branch is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Governor</strong>: The Governor is like the President for New York State. The Governor is elected by the people of New York for a four-year term. The current Governor works in Albany, the capital city of New York.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Governor also has helpers, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Lieutenant Governor</li>
                <li>The Attorney General</li>
                <li>The Comptroller</li>
                <li>Various state agencies and departments</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>THE JUDICIAL BRANCH</h3>
            <p>
                The Judicial Branch interprets laws and resolves disputes. New York's court system includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Court of Appeals</strong>: This is New York's highest court, similar to the U.S. Supreme Court.</li>
                <li><strong>Supreme Courts</strong>: Despite their name, these are not the highest courts! They handle major civil and criminal cases.</li>
                <li><strong>County Courts, Family Courts, and other local courts</strong>: These handle different types of cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <br /><!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>
                New York State's government, like the federal government, is designed to serve the people and protect their rights. By having a structure similar to the federal government, with three branches and checks and balances, New York's government helps ensure that power is balanced and that the government works for the benefit of all New Yorkers.
