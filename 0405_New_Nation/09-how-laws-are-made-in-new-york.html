            <!-- What is a Law? -->
            <h2>WHAT IS A LAW?</h2>
            <p>
                A law is a rule that everyone in a state or country must follow. Laws help keep people safe, protect their rights, and make sure everyone is treated fairly. In New York State, new laws are made through a process that involves many steps and people.
            </p>
            <h2>WHAT IS A BILL?</h2>
            <p>
                Before something becomes a law, it starts as a "bill." A bill is just an idea for a new law or a change to an existing law. Anyone can have an idea for a law, but only members of the New York State Legislature can introduce a bill.
            </p>
            <h2>THE STEPS FOR A BILL TO BECOME A LAW</h2>
            
            <!-- Step 1: The Idea -->
            <h3>STEP 1: THE IDEA</h3>
            <p>
                The process starts with an idea for a new law. This idea might come from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A legislator (a Senator or Assembly member)</li>
                <li>The Governor</li>
                <li>A citizen or group of citizens</li>
                <li>A community organization</li>
                <li>A business</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, students might suggest a law to make school lunches healthier, or community members might want a law to create more parks.
            </p>
            <h3>STEP 2: WRITING THE BILL</h3>
            <p>
                Once there's an idea, a legislator works with lawyers to write the bill. The bill must be written very carefully to explain exactly what the new law will do.
            </p>
            <h3>STEP 3: INTRODUCING THE BILL</h3>
            <p>
                The legislator introduces the bill in either the State Senate or the State Assembly. The bill gets a number and is printed so all legislators can read it.
            </p>
            <h3>STEP 4: COMMITTEE REVIEW</h3>
            <p>
                The bill goes to a committee that specializes in that type of issue. For example, a bill about schools would go to the Education Committee. The committee members:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study the bill</li>
                <li>May hold hearings where experts and citizens can share their opinions</li>
                <li>Vote on whether the bill should move forward</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If the committee doesn't like the bill, it might "die" here and not move forward.
            </p>
            <h3>STEP 5: FLOOR DEBATE AND VOTE</h3>
            <p>
                If the committee approves the bill, it goes to the "floor" of either the Senate or Assembly, where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All legislators can debate the bill</li>
                <li>Changes might be suggested</li>
                <li>All legislators vote on the bill</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>STEP 6: THE OTHER HOUSE</h3>
            <p>
                If the bill passes in one house (either the Senate or Assembly), it then goes to the other house and repeats steps 4 and 5. Both houses must pass the exact same version of the bill.
            </p>
            <h3>STEP 7: THE GOVERNOR'S DECISION</h3>
            <p>
                If both the Senate and Assembly pass the bill, it goes to the Governor, who has three choices:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign the bill, which makes it a law</li>
                <li>Veto (reject) the bill, which stops it from becoming a law</li>
                <li>Do nothing for 10 days, after which the bill automatically becomes a law (if the Legislature is in session)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>STEP 8: OVERRIDING A VETO (SOMETIMES)</h3>
            <p>
                If the Governor vetoes the bill, the Legislature can try to "override" the veto by voting again. They need a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a veto. This is difficult to achieve and doesn't happen often.
            </p>
            <h2>WHY THIS PROCESS IS IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                This process might seem long and complicated, but it's designed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure laws are carefully considered</li>
                <li>Allow many people to have input</li>
                <li>Prevent bad laws from being passed too quickly</li>
                <li>Create a system of checks and balances</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HOW CITIZENS CAN HELP MAKE LAWS</h2>
            <p>
                Even though you're not old enough to vote yet, you can still help make laws in New York:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write letters to your legislators about issues you care about</li>
                <li>Attend public hearings on bills</li>
                <li>Join community groups that work on important issues</li>
                <li>Learn about how government works so you'll be ready to vote when you're 18</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, in a democracy, the government works for the people. Your voice matters in making laws that affect your life and community!
