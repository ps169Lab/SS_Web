            <h2>WHAT IS THE BILL OF RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p>
                The Bill of Rights is the name for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Amendments are changes or additions to the Constitution. The Bill of Rights lists important freedoms and rights that belong to all Americans.
            </p>
            <h2>WHY WAS THE BILL OF RIGHTS CREATED?</h2>
            <p>
                When the Constitution was first written in 1787, it did not include a list of individual rights. Many people worried that without a written list of rights, the new government might become too powerful and take away people's freedoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some states said they would only approve the Constitution if a Bill of Rights was added. They wanted to make sure the government could not take away people's basic freedoms.

            <h2>WHO CREATED THE BILL OF RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p>
                James Madison, who later became our fourth president, wrote the Bill of Rights. He studied the constitutions of different states and the ideas of important thinkers to decide which rights to include.

            <!-- Why the Bill of Rights is Important -->
            <h2>WHY THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                The Bill of Rights is important because it protects the rights and freedoms of individuals and groups. It limits what the government can do and ensures that all Americans have certain basic rights that cannot be taken away. Even today, more than 200 years after it was written, the Bill of Rights continues to protect the freedoms that make America special.
