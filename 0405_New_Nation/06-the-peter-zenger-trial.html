            <h2>WHO WAS PETER ZENGER?</h2>
            <p>
                John Peter Zenger was a printer who lived in New York City in the 1730s. He was born in Germany and came to America when he was 13 years old. As an adult, he learned to be a printer and started a newspaper called the New York Weekly Journal in 1733.

            <!-- The Newspaper and the Governor -->
            <h2>THE NEWSPAPER AND THE GOVERNOR</h2>
            <p>
                In his newspaper, Zenger printed articles that criticized the royal governor of New York, William Cosby. Governor Cosby was not a good leader. He:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Took money that didn't belong to him</li>
                <li>Removed judges who disagreed with him</li>
                <li>Made unfair rules that hurt the people of New York</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Zenger's newspaper told the truth about these bad things that Governor Cosby was doing. The articles in Zenger's newspaper were written by people who wanted better government, but Zenger printed them in his paper.

            <!-- Zenger's Arrest -->
            <h2>ZENGER'S ARREST</h2>
            <p>
                Governor Cosby was very angry about what Zenger's newspaper was saying about him. In November 1734, he had Zenger arrested and put in jail. Zenger was charged with "seditious libel," which means publishing false statements that criticize the government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zenger spent almost 10 months in jail before his trial. During this time, his wife, Anna, kept the newspaper running!

            <!-- The Important Trial -->
            <h2>THE IMPORTANT TRIAL</h2>
            <p>
                Zenger's trial began on August 4, 1735, in New York City. His lawyer was Andrew Hamilton (not related to Alexander Hamilton), who was a famous lawyer from Philadelphia.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, the law said that if someone printed something bad about the government, they could be punished even if what they printed was true. The judge told the jury that they only needed to decide if Zenger had printed the articles, not whether the articles were true.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Andrew Hamilton made a bold argument. He said:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Yes, Zenger did print the articles</li>
                <li>But the articles were TRUE</li>
                <li>People should have the right to criticize the government when it does wrong</li>
                <li>Truth should be a defense against libel charges</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- The Jury's Decision -->
            <h2>THE JURY'S DECISION</h2>
            <p>
                After hearing Hamilton's arguments, the jury decided that Zenger was NOT GUILTY. This was a surprise to many people, because it went against what the law said at that time. The jury believed that people should be allowed to print the truth, even if it criticized the government.

            <h2>WHY THE TRIAL WAS IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                The Peter Zenger trial was very important for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Freedom of the Press</strong>: It helped establish the idea that newspapers should be free to print the truth, even when the truth criticizes the government.</li>
                <li><strong>Power of Juries</strong>: It showed that juries could make decisions based on what they thought was right, not just on what the law said.</li>
                <li><strong>Speaking Truth to Power</strong>: It showed that ordinary people could stand up to powerful leaders who were doing wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Starting point for the First Amendment</strong>: Later, when the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution, the First Amendment included freedom of the press. The Zenger trial helped show why this freedom was so important.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Even though the Zenger trial happened about 50 years before the Constitution was written, it helped shape American ideas about freedom of speech and freedom of the press that we still value today.
