            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
                New York City is the largest city in the United States, with over 8 million people living in its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. A city this big needs a special government to help it run smoothly. New York City has what's called a "mayor-council" form of government.
