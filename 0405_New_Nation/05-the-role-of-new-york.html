            <!-- Why New York Was Important -->
            <h2>WHY NEW YORK WAS IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                After the American Revolution, the United States was a brand new country trying to figure out how to govern itself. New York played a special and important role in helping the new nation grow strong. New York was very special at this time because many important people, debates, and events happened here. It is also important for the same reason that it has always been important - because of it's waterways. </p>

            <h2>NEW YORK AS THE FIRST CAPITAL</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that New York City was the first capital of the United States? In 1789, after the Constitution was adopted, George Washington was sworn in as the first President on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. The first Congress of the United States also met in New York City. Important decisions about how our new government would work were made right there in New York!

            <h2>KEY LEADERS FROM NEW YORK</h2>
            
            <!-- Alexander Hamilton -->
            <h3>Alexander Hamilton</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most important founding fathers came from New York. Alexander Hamilton was like a team captain for creating the new nation. He:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped write the Constitution</li>
                <li>Wrote many of the Federalist Papers (essays that convinced people to support the Constitution)</li>
                <li>Became the first Secretary of the Treasury and created our nation's financial system</li>
                <li>Started the Bank of New York, which helped the new country's economy grow</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- John Jay -->
            <h3>John Jay</h3>
            <p>
                Another important New Yorker was John Jay. He:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped write the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War</li>
                <li>Wrote some of the Federalist Papers with Hamilton</li>
                <li>Became the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court</li>
                <li>Served as Governor of New York</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/John_Jay_%28Gilbert_Stuart_portrait%29.jpg/500px-John_Jay_%28Gilbert_Stuart_portrait%29.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><h2>THE FEDERALIST PAPERS</h2>
            <p>
                The Federalist Papers were very important writings that explained why the Constitution was a good plan for America. Most of these papers were written in New York by Alexander Hamilton and other leaders. Since they were afraid that they would get in trouble for talking about the making of the Constitution before it was finished (it was supposed to be secret), they wrote under a fake name. They called themselves "Publius" - just like how people make up names for themselves today on social media. They wrote the Federalist Papers in newspapers every issue between August of 1787 and October of 1788 to convince New Yorkers to support the Constitution.
            </p>

            <p>
                New York didn't immediately agree to the Constitution. Many New Yorkers were worried that the new federal government might become too powerful and take away people's rights or the state's independence. There were big debates about whether New York should join the new nation under the Constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, after much discussion and the promise that a Bill of Rights would be added, New York became the 11th state to ratify (approve) the Constitution on July 26, 1788. After the Constitution was approved by New York, there was a big parade called "The Federal Procession of 1788".</p>

            <p>
                New York City quickly became one of the most important ports in America. Ships from all over the world came to New York to trade goods. This helped America:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build its economy (getting businesses set up so people make money)</li>
                <li>Make deas with other countries</li>
                <li>Grow into a nation where people were doing well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The busy harbor and markets of New York helped make America successful and respected in the world.

            <p>
                New York's early contributions to the United States helped shape our democracy and make our country strong. The leaders, ideas, and economic power that came from New York were essential in transforming the United States from a collection of former colonies into a unified and successful nation.
