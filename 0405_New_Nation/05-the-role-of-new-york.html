            <h2>WHY NEW YORK WAS IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                After the American Revolution, the United States was a brand new country trying to figure out how to govern itself. New York played a special and important role in helping the new nation grow strong. There were several reasons why New York was uniquely important in America's early days.

            <p>
                Did you know that New York City was the first capital of the United States? In 1789, after the Constitution was adopted, George Washington was sworn in as the first President on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. The first Congress of the United States also met in New York City. Important decisions about how our new government would work were made right there in New York!

            <h2>THE FEDERALIST PAPERS</h2>
            <p>
                The Federalist Papers were very important writings that explained why the Constitution was a good plan for America.

            <!-- New York's Debate Over the Constitution -->
            <h2>NEW YORK'S DEBATE OVER THE CONSTITUTION</h2>
            <p>
                New York didn't immediately agree to the Constitution. Many New Yorkers were worried that the new federal government might become too powerful and take away people's rights or the state's independence. There were big debates about whether New York should join the new nation under the Constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, after much discussion and the promise that a Bill of Rights would be added, New York became the 11th state to ratify (approve) the Constitution on July 26, 1788.

            <p>
                New York City quickly became one of the most important ports in America. Ships from all over the world came to New York to trade goods. This helped America:
