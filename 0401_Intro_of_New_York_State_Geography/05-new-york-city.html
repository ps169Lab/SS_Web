                Urban centers represent concentrated populations and economic activity within relatively small geographic areas. New York City, with over 8.3 million residents, stands as the most populous city in the United States and serves as a global center for finance, culture, and international commerce.

            <p>
                New York City is made up of five big neighborhoods called boroughs. Think of it like a pizza cut into five slices - each slice is different, but they all make up one delicious pizza! Each borough has its own special things, but they all work together as one big city.
            </p>

            <h2>The Five Borough System</h2>
            
            <p>
                Each borough is like a different flavor of ice cream - they're all unique and special in their own way! But when you put them all together, they make New York City the most amazing and diverse place in the world.
            </p>

                Manhattan serves as the city's commercial and cultural core, featuring the world's largest concentration of skyscrapers and major landmarks including Times Square and Central Park.

                The Statue of Liberty is like a giant green lady holding a torch, welcoming people to America since 1886! She represents freedom for everyone.
