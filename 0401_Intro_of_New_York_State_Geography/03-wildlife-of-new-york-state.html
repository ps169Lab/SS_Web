                All animals and plants have special features that help them survive in their homes. These special features are called adaptations. Animals in New York State have many different adaptations to help them live in the forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Animals-in-New-York-NY.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                All mammals have fur to help them stay warm in New York's cold winters. All birds have feathers that keep them warm and help them fly. Fish have special body parts called gills that let them breathe underwater. Plants have roots to get water and leaves to make food from sunlight.
            </p>

            <h2>How Animals Stay Warm</h2>
            
            <p>
                New York gets very cold in winter, so animals need ways to stay warm. Many animals grow thick fur coats. Some animals store fat in their bodies to keep warm. Other animals sleep through the winter in a deep sleep called hibernation.

            <p>
                The American Beaver is New York's state animal. Beavers have thick, waterproof fur that keeps them warm when they swim in cold water. Black bears eat lots of food in fall to store fat, then sleep through winter in dens.</p>

            <h2>How Animals Find Food</h2>

            <p>Animals have special ways to find and eat food. They have different body parts and ways to hunt.

            <p>
                The bluebird is New York's bird! Bluebirds have good eyes to see bugs and a beak to catch them.</p><p><img src="https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/293922/fill-364x406%7Cformat-webp%7Cwebpquality-70/" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p>Brook trout have colors that help them hide in the water. They eat small bugs.
            </p>

            <h2>Hiding and Staying Safe</h2>

            <p>
                Animals hide from animals that want to eat them. They use colors and patterns to blend in or look scary.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.blog.sawmillriveraudubon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/weasel-family-978x400.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>Some animals change colors with the seasons. The Shorttail Weasel has brown fur in summer but grows white fur in winter to match the snow.Â </p>

            <h2>What Plants Do</h2>

            <p><img src="https://mediacdn.nhbs.com/jackets/jackets_resizer_xlarge/23/231833_1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

            <p>Plants also have adaptations to help them survive in New York. Trees like the Sugar Maple lose their leaves in winter to save energy. Their leaves turn beautiful colors in fall before they drop off.</p><p>Some plants have special ways to get the nutrients they need. Pitcher plants catch and eat insects because they live in places where the soil doesn't have enough nutrients for them to grow.</p>

            <h2>Saving Animals</h2>

            <p>
                New York has parks to keep animals safe. This helps animals and plants live happily. Kids can learn about New York's nature! All animals need food to live and grow. Different animals eat different things and have special body parts to help them get food. Some animals eat plants, some eat other animals, and some eat both plants and animals.</p>
