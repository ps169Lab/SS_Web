                New York's Diverse Wildlife
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                All animals and plants have special features that help them survive in their homes. These special features are called adaptations. Animals in New York State have many different adaptations to help them live in the forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Animals-in-New-York-NY.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                All mammals have fur to help them stay warm in New York's cold winters. All birds have feathers that keep them warm and help them fly. Fish have special body parts called gills that let them breathe underwater. Plants have roots to get water and leaves to make food from sunlight.
            </p>

            <h2>How Animals Stay Warm</h2>
            
            <p>
                New York gets very cold in winter, so animals need ways to stay warm. Many animals grow thick fur coats. Some animals store fat in their bodies to keep warm. Other animals sleep through the winter in a deep sleep called hibernation.
            </p><p><img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/10291239/r/il/7a2b24/3791226908/il_fullxfull.3791226908_dhqr.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The American Beaver is New York's state animal. Beavers have thick, waterproof fur that keeps them warm when they swim in cold water. Black bears eat lots of food in fall to store fat, then sleep through winter in dens.
            </p>

            <h2>How Animals Find Food</h2>

            <p>
                All animals need food to live and grow. Different animals eat different things and have special body parts to help them get food. Some animals eat plants, some eat other animals, and some eat both plants and animals.
            </p><p><img src="https://knilt.arcc.albany.edu/images/5/54/Birds-of-New-York.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The Eastern Bluebird is New York's state bird. Bluebirds have sharp beaks for catching insects. They also have good eyesight to spot bugs from far away. Fish like the Brook Trout have special coloring that helps them hide from bigger fish that might eat them.
            </p>

            <h2>How Animals Hide from Danger</h2>

            <p>
                Many animals use camouflage to hide from predators. Camouflage means having colors or patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings. This helps them stay safe from animals that want to eat them.
            </p><p><img src="https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/293922/fill-364x406%7Cformat-webp%7Cwebpquality-70/" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Some animals change colors with the seasons. The Shorttail Weasel has brown fur in summer but grows white fur in winter to match the snow. Brook Trout have spotted patterns that help them blend in with the rocky bottoms of streams.
            </p>

            <h2>How Plants Survive</h2>

            <p>
                Plants also have adaptations to help them survive in New York. Trees like the Sugar Maple lose their leaves in winter to save energy. Their leaves turn beautiful colors in fall before they drop off.
            </p><p><img src="https://mediacdn.nhbs.com/jackets/jackets_resizer_xlarge/23/231833_1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Some plants have special ways to get the nutrients they need. Pitcher plants catch and eat insects because they live in places where the soil doesn't have enough nutrients for them to grow.
            </p>

            <h2>Protecting Wildlife</h2>

            <p>
                New York State has special parks and protected areas where wildlife can live safely. These places help make sure that future children will be able to see and learn about New York's amazing animals and plants.
