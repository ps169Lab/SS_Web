            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Landforms are natural features of Earth's surface, including mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. New York State exhibits remarkable topographical diversity, shaped by millions of years of geological processes. The state's varied landscape results from glacial activity, tectonic forces, and erosion over extensive time periods.</span>

New York State has many different landforms, shaped by millions of years of Earth processes. The state's different landscapes were made by glaciers, moving land, and erosion over long time periods.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">A long, long time ago, giant sheets of ice called glaciers moved back and forth across New York many times. When these huge ice sheets melted about 10,000 years ago, they left behind special land shapes like the Hudson River valley, the Finger Lakes, and piles of rocks and dirt that we can still see today!</span>

            <h2>Mountain Regions</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York contains two major mountain systems that significantly influence regional climate and ecology. These elevated regions create diverse habitats and affect precipitation patterns across the state.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">New York has two major mountain systems that greatly affect the weather and nature. These high areas create different homes for animals and affect rain and snow patterns across the state.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Adirondack Mountains occupy northeastern New York and contain Mount Marcy, the state's highest peak at 5,344 feet. The Adirondack Park encompasses six million acres, making it larger than Yellowstone, Everglades, and Grand Canyon National Parks combined. The Catskill Mountains feature older, more rounded peaks with numerous waterfalls and fast-flowing streams.</span>

            <h2>Water Systems</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York's extensive network of rivers and lakes provides crucial water resources and transportation routes. These water bodies were largely shaped by glacial activity and continue to influence human settlement patterns and economic development.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">New York's many rivers and lakes provide important water and transportation routes. These water bodies were mostly shaped by glaciers and continue to affect where people live and how they make money.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hudson River flows 315 miles from the Adirondacks to New York Harbor, serving as a major transportation corridor. The Finger Lakes region contains eleven glacially-carved lakes that extend north-south through central New York. These deep lakes moderate local climate and support agriculture, particularly viticulture.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">New York touches two Great Lakes - Erie and Ontario - which hold about 20% of all the fresh water on Earth's surface! The Niagara River connects these lakes and creates the famous Niagara Falls, where water drops 167 feet down over rocky cliffs - that's like falling off a 16-story building!</span>

            <h2>Lowland Regions</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York's lowland areas include coastal plains and lake plains that provide fertile agricultural land and sites for major population centers. These relatively flat regions contrast sharply with the state's mountainous areas.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">New York's lowland areas include coastal plains and lake plains that provide good farming land and places for big cities. These flat areas are very different from the state's mountainous areas.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Long Island is made of stuff left behind by glaciers that forms a flat area near the coast. The flat lands near Buffalo used to be the bottom of ancient lakes! These areas are great for farming and building cities because the land is flat and the soil is really good for growing things.</span>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York's many different land shapes create different weather patterns and homes for plants and animals throughout the state. Mountain areas are cooler and get more rain and snow, while flat areas are perfect for farming and building cities. All these different landscapes help support many different kinds of plants, animals, and ways for people to make a living!</span>
