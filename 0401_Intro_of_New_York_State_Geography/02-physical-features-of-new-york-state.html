            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Landforms are natural shapes on Earth like mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. New York State has many different land shapes. They were made by ice, moving land, and rocks wearing away over a very long time.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Land shapes are things like mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. New York has many different land shapes. Ice and moving land made them long ago.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">A long, long time ago, giant sheets of ice called glaciers moved back and forth across New York many times. When these huge ice sheets melted about 10,000 years ago, they left behind special land shapes like the Hudson River valley, the Finger Lakes, and piles of rocks and dirt that we can still see today!</span>

            <h2>Mountain Regions</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York has two big mountain areas that change the weather and nature. These high places make different homes for animals and change how much rain and snow falls.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Adirondack Mountains are in the northeast part of New York. They have Mount Marcy, the tallest mountain in New York at 5,344 feet. The Adirondack Park is huge - bigger than three famous parks put together. The Catskill Mountains are older and rounder with lots of waterfalls and fast streams.</span>

            <h2>Water Systems</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York has many rivers and lakes that give people water and ways to travel. Ice made most of these water places long ago. They still affect where people live and work today.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hudson River flows 315 miles from the mountains to New York Harbor. It's a big travel route. The Finger Lakes are eleven lakes made by ice that go from north to south. These deep lakes help control the weather and help farmers grow grapes.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York touches two Great Lakes - Erie and Ontario - which hold about 20% of all the fresh water on Earth's surface! The Niagara River connects these lakes and creates the famous Niagara Falls, where water drops 167 feet down over rocky cliffs - that's like falling off a 16-story building!</span>

            <h2>Lowland Regions</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York has flat areas near the coast and lakes that are good for farming and big cities. These flat places are very different from the mountain areas.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Long Island is made of stuff left by ice that makes a flat area near the ocean. The flat lands near Buffalo used to be the bottom of old lakes! These areas are great for farms and cities because the land is flat and the soil is good for growing things.</span>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York's different land shapes make different weather and homes for plants and animals. Mountain areas are cooler and get more rain and snow. Flat areas are perfect for farms and cities. All these different places help many different plants, animals, and people live!</span>
