                How New York's Land Was Made
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>

                All places on Earth have different types of land called landforms. Landforms are natural features like mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. New York State has many different landforms that were made over thousands of years by ice, water, and weather.

            <p>
                Long ago, huge sheets of ice called glaciers moved across New York. When the ice melted, it left behind the mountains, valleys, lakes, and rivers we see today. This is how many of New York's landforms were created.
            </p>

            <h2>Mountains in New York</h2>
            
            <p>
                Mountains are high areas of land that rise up from the ground around them. New York State has two main mountain areas. Mountains are important because they affect the weather and provide homes for many plants and animals.
            </p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/what-makes-new-york-state-topography-fascinating-v0-j0h3xnop5ykb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a782238246aeb86e117711c6daf724a4543682d4" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The Adirondack Mountains are in the northern part of New York. They have the state's highest mountain, called Mount Marcy. The Catskill Mountains are in the southern part of the state. They have rounded tops and many streams and waterfalls.

            <h2>Rivers and Lakes</h2>

            <p>
                Rivers are flowing water that moves from high places to low places. Lakes are large areas of water surrounded by land. New York has many important rivers and lakes that provide water for people, plants, and animals.

            <p>
                The Hudson River is New York's most important river. It flows from north to south and connects to the Atlantic Ocean. The Finger Lakes are a group of long, narrow lakes that look like fingers on a map. They were carved out by glaciers long ago.

            <p>
                New York also borders two of the Great Lakes - Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. These are some of the largest lakes in the world. The famous Niagara Falls is where water from Lake Erie flows down to Lake Ontario.
            </p>

            <h2>Flat Areas</h2>

            <p>
                Not all of New York is mountains and hills. Some areas are flat or have gentle slopes. These flat areas are called plains or lowlands. Flat land is good for farming because it's easier to grow crops and raise animals there.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.travelandleisure.com/thmb/Jyak4LUtxfC6C4UFtxm4caPGeZA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__mnn__images__2016__12__New_York_City_skyline-c32994448b404131a4f6829b952951f5.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Long Island and the area around New York City are mostly flat. The area near Buffalo and the Great Lakes is also flat. This flat land was once covered by ancient lakes and glaciers.
            </p>

            <h2>How Landforms Affect Life</h2>

            <p>
                Different landforms create different places for plants and animals to live. Mountains are cooler and get more snow. Rivers and lakes provide fresh water. Flat areas are warmer and better for farming. All these different landforms working together make New York State a special place with many different types of life.
