                How New York is Set Up
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                All states are organized into smaller parts to help people govern themselves. These smaller parts are called counties, cities, and towns. New York State is divided up this way to make it easier for people to have local governments that understand their needs.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/img_auth.php/d/d6/New-york-county-map.gif" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Every state has a capital city where the state government meets to make laws. New York State has 62 counties, and each county has its own local government. Some counties have big cities, and some have mostly small towns and farms.
            </p>

            <h2>Albany is the Capital</h2>
            
            <p>

                Albany is the capital city of New York State. This is where the governor works and where state lawmakers meet to make laws for the whole state. Albany was chosen as the capital because it is located in a good spot along the Hudson River for transportation and trade.
            </p><p><img src="https://static1.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/albany-new-york-state-capital.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Albany is not the biggest city in New York, but it is the most important city for state government. It has been the capital since 1797, making it one of the oldest capital cities in America.
            </p>

            <h2>Big Cities and Small Towns</h2>

            <p>
                New York State has both very big cities and very small towns. Cities are places where many people live close together. Towns are smaller places where fewer people live and there is more open space.
            </p>

            <p>
                New York City is the biggest city in the whole United States. More than 8 million people live there! Other big cities in New York State include Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. These cities grew big because they were good places for trade and business.
            </p>

            <h2>Where People Live</h2>

            <p>
                Most people in New York State live in cities rather than in the countryside. About 9 out of every 10 people live in urban areas. Many people live in and around New York City because there are lots of jobs and opportunities there.
            </p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/New_York_Population_Map.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The northern and western parts of New York State have fewer people because much of the land is mountains and forests. The areas near rivers and lakes have more people because the land is flatter and better for farming and building.
            </p>

            <h2>How Geography Affects Where People Live</h2>

            <p>
                The shape of the land affects where people choose to live and work. Rivers provide water and transportation, so many cities grew up along rivers like the Hudson River. Flat land is easier to farm and build on, so more people live in flat areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Great Lakes in western New York made Buffalo an important city for shipping goods. The mountains in northern New York have fewer people, but they are important for tourism and protecting nature.
            </p>

            <h2>Working Together</h2>

            <p>

                All the different parts of New York State - the big cities, small towns, farms, and wild areas - work together to make the state strong. Each area contributes something special, whether it's business, farming, tourism, or natural resources.
            </p><p><img src="https://ontheworldmap.com/usa/city/new-york-city/map-of-new-york-city-max.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Understanding how New York State is organized helps us see how geography and people work together to create communities and governments that serve everyone's needs.
