                How New York is Set Up
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                All states are organized into smaller parts to help people govern themselves. These smaller parts are called counties, cities, and towns. </p><p><img src="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/img_auth.php/d/d6/New-york-county-map.gif" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>New York State has 62 counties, and each county has its own local government. Some counties have big cities, and some have mostly small towns and farms.
            </p>

            <h2>Albany is the Capital</h2>
            
            <p>

                Albany is the capital city of New York State. A capital city is where the laws for the state are made.</p><p><img src="https://static1.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/albany-new-york-state-capital.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>It has been the capital since 1797, making it one of the oldest capital cities in America.
            </p>

            <h2>Big Cities and Small Towns</h2>

            <p>
                New York State has both very big cities and very small towns. Cities are places where many people live close together. Towns are smaller places where fewer people live and there is more open space.
            </p><p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woodstock-new-york-royalty-free-image-1686668103.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.986xh;0,0.0137xh&amp;resize=980:*" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                New York City is the biggest city in the whole United States. More than 8 million people live there! Other big cities in New York State include Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. </p>

            <h2>Where People Live</h2>

            <p>
                Most people in New York State live in cities rather than in the countryside. About 9 out of every 10 people live in urban areas. Many people live in and around New York City because there are lots of jobs and opportunities there.

            <h2>How Geography Affects Where People Live</h2>

            <p>
                The shape of the land affects where people choose to live and work. Rivers provide water and transportation, so many cities grew up along rivers like the Hudson River. Flat land is easier to farm and build on, so more people live in flat areas.
            </p><p><img src="https://assets.farmsanctuary.org/content/uploads/2020/05/27054216/2017_06-02_FSNY_Sheep_pasture_landscape_DSC_8640_CREDIT_Farm_Sanctuary-scaled-e1594087075277.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The Great Lakes in western New York made Buffalo an important city for shipping goods. </p>

            <h2>Working Together</h2>

            <p>

                All the different parts of New York State work together to make the state strong. Each area contributes something special, whether it's business, farming, tourism, or natural resources.

            <p>
                Understanding how New York State is organized helps us see how geography and people work together to create communities and governments that serve everyone's needs.
