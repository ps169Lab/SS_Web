                How New York State is Divided
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                Political geography examines how governmental boundaries and administrative divisions organize territory and populations. New York State demonstrates complex political organization through its system of counties, cities, towns, and villages, each serving specific governmental functions within the broader state framework.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/img_auth.php/d/d6/New-york-county-map.gif" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                New York State is made up of 62 counties - think of them like big neighborhoods with their own local governments. This county system was started way back in colonial times and provides important services like police, schools, and fixing roads. Counties also help decide who represents the state in government!
            </p>

            <h2>Albany - The State Capital</h2>
            
            <p>
                Albany serves as New York's capital city and houses the state government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Located strategically along the Hudson River, Albany was selected as the permanent capital in 1797 due to its central location and excellent transportation connections.
            </p><p><img src="https://static1.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/albany-new-york-state-capital.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Even though Albany only has about 99,000 people living there, it's way more important politically than its size would suggest! The city has been the capital for over 225 years, making it one of the longest-serving state capitals in all of American history.
            </p>

            <h2>Urban and Rural Distribution</h2>

            <p>
                New York State has very different patterns of where people live. Urban areas pack lots and lots of people into small spaces, while rural areas have fewer people spread out over much bigger areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                New York City, with over 8.3 million people, is the biggest city in the whole United States! Other big cities in New York include Buffalo (278,000 people), Rochester (211,000 people), and Syracuse (148,000 people). These cities grew big because they were in great spots for trading goods, making things, and moving people and products around.
            </p>

            <h2>Population Patterns</h2>

            <p>
                Approximately 92% of New York's nearly 20 million residents live in urban areas, with the majority concentrated in the New York City metropolitan region. This high urbanization rate reflects historical economic opportunities and geographic advantages of certain locations.
            </p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/New_York_Population_Map.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The Adirondack and Catskill mountain areas don't have very many people living there because the land is mountainous and much of it is protected forest. On the other hand, areas along big rivers and transportation routes have lots more people and businesses.
            </p>

            <h2>Geographic Influence on Settlement</h2>

            <p>
                The land and water features really affect where people choose to live and work throughout New York State. Natural things like rivers, lakes, and whether the land is flat or mountainous help decide where towns and cities are built and grow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Hudson River area made it easy for early settlers to build communities and still supports big cities today. Buffalo's spot near the Great Lakes made it a super important place for shipping goods, while the Erie Canal helped New York become really important for people moving west and for business.
            </p>

            <h2>Regional Interdependence</h2>

            <p>
                New York State's diverse regions - urban centers, agricultural areas, and wilderness preserves - function as interconnected components of a larger economic and political system. Each region contributes unique resources and capabilities that strengthen the state's overall prosperity.

            <p>
                Learning about how New York's government is organized shows us how the land, history, and government structures all work together to help run the state effectively across all its different landscapes and people.
