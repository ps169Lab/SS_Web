                How New York is Set Up
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                New York is set up in areas with governments. These areas are called counties, cities, towns, and villages. They all help New York work.
            </p><p><img src="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/img_auth.php/d/d6/New-york-county-map.gif" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                New York has 62 counties. They are like big neighborhoods with their own governments. They help with police, schools, and roads.
            </p>

            <h2>Albany is the Capital</h2>
            
            <p>
                Albany is New York's capital city. The government is there. It's in the middle of the state and easy to get to.
            </p><p><img src="https://static1.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/albany-new-york-state-capital.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                Albany doesn't have many people, but it's important. It's been the capital for a long time!
            </p>

            <h2>Cities and Country</h2>

            <p>
                New York has cities and country areas. Cities have many people close together. Country areas have fewer people far apart.
            </p>

            <p>
                New York City has the most people in the United States! Other big cities are Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. These cities are good for trading and making things.
            </p>

            <h2>Where People Live</h2>

            <p>
                Most people in New York live in cities. New York City has the most.
            </p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/New_York_Population_Map.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The mountains don't have many people because it's hard to live there. Areas near rivers have more people.
            </p>

            <h2>How Land Helps People</h2>

            <p>
                The land and water help people choose where to live in New York. Rivers, lakes, and mountains help decide where cities are built.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Hudson River helps people build towns. Buffalo is near the Great Lakes, so it's good for shipping.
            </p>

            <h2>Working Together</h2>

            <p>
                New York's areas work together. Cities, farms, and parks all help each other.

            <p>
                Learning how New York works shows us how the land, history, and government help the state.
