            <h1>Nigeria's Major Rivers</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Nigeria is the biggest country in West Africa by population and is known for having over 250 different
                groups of people. The land in Nigeria is very different depending on where you are: in the dry north,
                you’ll see flat grasslands called savannah, but as you travel south to the edge of the Atlantic Ocean,
                the land is filled with thick, green rainforests.</p>

            <h2>Rivers Shape Nigeria</h2>
            <p>Nigeria gets its name from the Niger River, which is the longest river in the country and stretches for
                4,100 kilometers (2,547 miles). The Benue River is the Niger’s main “helper” river, called a tributary.
                What makes these rivers really special is that they meet almost in the middle of Nigeria, making a giant
                Y shape and forming the largest part of the land.</p><p> Even though both rivers are big and important, the
                Niger is the longest, and the Benue is its main partner. There are sometimes floods in the low and wet
                southern areas of Nigeria, but there isn’t a big difference in flooding between these two rivers.</p>

            <h2>Life by the Rivers</h2>
            <p>For hundreds of years, the land next to these great rivers has helped people live and grow strong. As far
                back as the 9th century, important towns grew near the water. For example, the Yoruba people believe
                their story begins in the ancient city of Ile-Ife, which is close to the Niger River. The rivers made it
                possible for these early groups to grow crops and get food easily.</p><p> Even today, the big mangrove swamps
                in the Niger Delta, where the two rivers join the sea, are like baby fish “nurseries”—almost 40% of all
                the fish caught nearby start their lives here. This means many people who live near the rivers have
                always had enough healthy food to eat.</p>
