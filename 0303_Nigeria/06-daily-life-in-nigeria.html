            <h2>School</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">
                <span class="standard-reading">Many children in Nigeria start their mornings by walking to school with friends or siblings. The walk can take 15–20 minutes, and along the way kids talk, laugh, and watch the busy streets wake up. Most students wear uniforms — often bright shirts with matching shorts or skirts — which makes the school day feel special. Classrooms can be lively because there are many students, but children still work hard on reading, writing, math, and local languages. Break time is everyone’s favorite moment, when kids rush outside to play football or chase games.</span>

            <h2>Home Life</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Families in Nigeria often live close together, with parents, children, and sometimes grandparents sharing the same home or courtyard. Houses look different depending on where people live: in cities, families might live in apartment buildings, while in small towns or villages, homes may be made of bricks or mud. Kids usually help with simple chores like sweeping the yard or carrying small items to help their parents. In the evenings, when the heat starts to fade, many families sit outside to talk, relax, and enjoy the cooler air together.</span>

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Nigerian meals are full of flavor and color. A family might cook jollof rice — a bright red rice dish — or fry sweet plantains that smell amazing as they sizzle. Vegetable stews, beans, and flatbreads are also common meals. Many families cook over a small gas stove or outside over a fire, and the warm smell of dinner often drifts through the whole home. Eating together is important, and children often share food from one big bowl with their siblings.</span>

            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Getting around Nigeria depends on where you live. In big cities, the streets are busy with yellow buses, taxis, and small vans called danfos weaving through traffic. In quieter areas, many people walk or ride motorbikes to school, to work, or to the market. Children might walk together in small groups, greeting neighbors as they pass. Wherever you go, the roads are full of movement and energy.</span>

            <h2>Play & Community</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Children in Nigeria love to play outside whenever they can. Football (soccer) is the most popular game, and kids will use any open space — a courtyard, a field, or a quiet street — as their field. When chores and homework are done, neighborhoods often fill with laughter and running feet. Community is important, and many families know their neighbors well. Music, dancing, and celebrations bring people together throughout the year.</span>
