            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hausa people are one of Nigeria's largest ethnic groups, with most living in northern Nigeria where the environment is drier and more like a savanna. The Hausa people have adapted their way of life to match their natural environment, which has less rainfall and more open grasslands than southern Nigeria.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">For hundreds of years, the Hausa people have been skilled traders and merchants. Their location in northern Nigeria, close to the Sahara Desert, made them important middlemen in trade between North Africa and the rest of West Africa. They used the natural resources of their environment to build a successful trading culture.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Hausa people are very good at trading. They live close to a big desert. This helped them trade with many different places. They use what they find in nature to make money.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hausa people live in an environment with less water and fewer trees than southern Nigeria, so they have developed cultural practices that work well in this drier climate.

                <span class="standard-reading">Hausa architecture reflects their environment too. They build houses with thick mud walls that stay cool during hot days and warm during cool nights. Many Hausa buildings have flat roofs and small windows to keep out the heat and dust from the dry northern winds.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hausa language is spoken by more people in West Africa than any other local language. This happened because Hausa traders traveled to many different places, and their language became the common language for trade across the region.</span>
