            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Mbari homes are very special in Nigerian culture. These are not houses where people live. Instead, they are art houses built by the Igbo people. They build them as gifts to their gods. Mbari houses are made from clay. They are decorated with colorful sculptures. The sculptures show people, animals, and spirits. The whole community works together for many years to build these houses.</span>

In dry areas, people use clay and mud. In swamps, people build on stilts. They use bamboo and reeds. The materials people use depend on where they live.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Nigerian homes show how culture comes from the environment. The materials people use come from nature around them. The way they build comes from nature. Even the decorations come from nature. Mbari houses are a good example. They use local clay. The sculptures show Igbo beliefs and stories.</span>
