                <span class="standard-reading">The Yoruba people live in southwestern Nigeria in a tropical rainforest and savanna biome. They use natural resources like mud, palm oil, and palm leaves to build their homes. Yoruba houses have thick mud walls that keep them cool and courtyards in the center where families gather. The roofs are made from palm thatch, which keeps rain out and lets air flow through.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Hausa people live in northern Nigeria in a dry savanna and semi-desert biome. They build their homes with sun-dried mud bricks called adobe because there are few trees but lots of clay soil. Hausa houses have thick walls and small windows to keep out the hot sun and sand. Many homes have flat roofs and courtyards where families can stay cool in the shade.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Igbo people live in southeastern Nigeria in a tropical rainforest and swamp biome. They use wood, bamboo, and palm leaves from the forest to build their homes. Because it rains a lot, Igbo houses often have steep roofs so water runs off quickly. Some houses are built on stilts to stay dry during floods. The Igbo also build special houses called Mbari.</span>

            <h2>THE SPECIAL PLACE OF MBARI HOMES</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Mbari homes are very special in Nigerian culture. These are not regular houses where people live. Instead, they are sacred art houses built by the Igbo people as gifts to their gods, especially Ala, the earth goddess. Mbari houses are made from anthill clay and decorated with colorful sculptures of people, animals, and spirits. The whole community works together for years to build these beautiful houses.</span>

            <!-- Natural Resources and Building -->
            <h2>HOW NATURAL RESOURCES SHAPE HOMES</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Each biome in Nigeria has different natural resources, and people use what is available in their area to build homes. In the forest regions, people use wood and palm leaves. In the dry regions, people use clay and mud. In the wetlands, people build on stilts using bamboo and reeds. This shows how the culture of building homes is connected to the natural environment.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">People in different parts of Nigeria use different materials to build homes. Forest people use wood. Desert people use mud. Swamp people use bamboo and build on stilts.</span>

            <!-- Cultural Connection -->
            <h2>HOMES REFLECT CULTURE</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Nigerian homes show how people's culture is shaped by their natural environment. The materials they use, the way they build, and even the decorations on their houses all come from the natural resources around them. Mbari houses are the best example of this - they use local clay and show the Igbo people's beliefs and stories through beautiful art.</span>

Today Nigerians live in modern homes like us, but they still keep their culture when they are building them. </span></p><p><span class="easy-reading"><img src="https://mixtafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Nigerian-House-Plan-Designs.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></span></p><p><span class="easy-reading"><img src="https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emirs-Palace-within-the-ancient-city-of-Zazzau-Zaria.-Photo-Twitter-hallaboutafrica.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></span></p><p><span class="easy-reading"><br /></span></p><p><span class="easy-reading"><br /></span></p>
