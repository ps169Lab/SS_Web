                    New York to Los Angeles! The Benue River is its biggest branch. They meet in a Y-shape and flow to the Atlantic
                    Ocean. Nigeria got its name from the Niger River!</span> <span class="easy-reading">Nigeria has two big rivers -

            <h2>HOW RIVERS SHAPED NIGERIA'S HISTORY</h2>
            <p><span class="standard-reading">For thousands of years, these rivers have been like water highways! People traveled on
                    boats to visit towns and trade goods. Ancient kingdoms grew along the riverbanks because rivers provided water
                    for drinking, farming, and easy travel. The rivers connected different groups and helped them share ideas and
                    cultures.</span> <span class="easy-reading">People have used these rivers like roads for a very long time. They
                    traveled on boats and traded goods. Towns grew up next to the rivers because people needed the water.</span></p>

            <h2>HOW RIVERS AFFECTED CULTURE</h2>
            <p><span class="standard-reading">The rivers created rich soil perfect for farming yams, rice, and vegetables. Fishing
                    became important for communities near the water. The Niger Delta, where the river meets the ocean, became home
                    to many groups who developed special cultures around fishing and farming. Rivers helped spread languages,
                    religions, and traditions across Nigeria.</span> <span class="easy-reading">The rivers made the soil good for
                    growing food. People learned to fish and farm. Different groups of people lived near the rivers and shared their
                    ways of life.</span></p>
