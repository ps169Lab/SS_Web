        Nigeria is a country in West Africa. The land looks very different from the south to the north. 
        In the <strong>south</strong>, near the ocean, there are swamps with mangrove trees that grow in salty water. 
        Just above the coast, in the <strong>southeast and southwest</strong>, there are thick rainforests where it rains a lot. </span></p><p><img src="https://images.myguide-cdn.com/nigeria/blog/the-best-national-parks-in-nigeria/large/the-best-national-parks-in-nigeria-140863.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><span class="standard-reading">In the <strong>middle part</strong> of the country, there are wide grasslands called savannas. These areas have tall grass and a few trees. </span></p><p><img src="https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/02/20/1424589-1440sssavannafeat-1030x580.webp" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><span class="standard-reading"> The <strong>north</strong> is much drier and hotter, with sandy soil and little rain. The land there looks almost like a desert. 
        As you move from the south to the north, the land gets drier and the trees become fewer.
