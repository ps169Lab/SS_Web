            <!-- Mangrove Trees -->
            <h2>MANGROVE TREES</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Mangrove trees live in the coastal wetlands of southern Nigeria, especially around the Niger River and Cross River deltas. These amazing trees have special adaptations that let them live in salty water where most other trees cannot survive. Their roots stick up out of the water to get air, and they can filter salt out of the seawater they drink.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Mangrove trees are very important to Nigeria's ecosystem. They provide homes for fish, birds, and other animals. The Niger Delta mangrove swamps are the breeding ground for 40% of the fish caught in the ocean nearby. These trees also protect the coast from big waves and storms.</span>

            <h2>THE CROSS RIVER GORILLA</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Cross River Gorilla is one of Nigeria's most special animals, but it is critically endangered. Only about 300 of these gorillas are left in the world! They live in the dense rainforests along the border between Nigeria and Cameroon. These gorillas are adapted to life in the thick forest where they swing through trees and eat leaves, fruits, and bark.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Cross River Gorillas have strong arms and hands that help them climb trees and move through the forest. They live in small family groups and are very shy around people. Their dark fur helps them blend in with the shadows of the forest. These gorillas are endangered because people have cut down many of their forest homes.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Black-crowned Cranes are adapted to life in both wet and dry areas. They eat fish, frogs, insects, and seeds. Their long necks help them reach food in the water and on the ground. These beautiful birds can also fly long distances to find food and water. Sadly, they are endangered because their wetland homes are being destroyed.</span>

            <h2>NIGERIA'S DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Nigeria has many different biomes that provide homes for different animals and plants. The coastal wetlands in the south have mangrove swamps. Moving inland, there are tropical rainforests with thick trees. The middle of Nigeria has savannas with grasslands and scattered trees.
