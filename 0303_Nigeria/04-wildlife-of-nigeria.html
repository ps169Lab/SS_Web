            <h1>Nigeria's Wildlife</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Nigeria has many different environments, like swamps, forests, and savannahs. Because the land and weather can change a lot, plants and animals have special adaptations that help them survive.</p>
<h2>Staying Safe from Heat and Dryness</h2>
<p>Some plants in Nigeria have adaptations that help them survive long, hot dry seasons. Trees like Lophira lanceolata and Vitellaria paradoxa can live for months with little water and can even survive wildfires in the savannah. These adaptations help them stay alive when the weather is very dry.</p>

<h2>Living in Water</h2>
<p>Many animals in Nigeria are adapted to life in rivers, lakes, and swamps. The common hippopotamus has eyes, ears, and nostrils high on its head so it can stay mostly underwater while still seeing, hearing, and breathing. Hippos also make a natural red “sunscreen” to protect their skin. The African manatee is another large animal that is built for swimming and living in the water.</p>

<h2>Seeing at Night</h2>
<p>Some animals survive by being active at night, when it is safer and cooler. The Senegal bushbaby is a small animal with very large eyes that help it see in the dark as it jumps from tree to tree. These nighttime adaptations help it find food and stay safe from predators.</p>

<h2>Finding Food</h2>
<p>Other animals have body parts that help them hunt or search for food. The aardvark has a long nose for sniffing insects underground and can fold its ears back to keep dirt out while digging. The leopard hunts by hiding and then running very fast—up to 58 km/h—to catch its prey. The serval, another wild cat, has long legs that help it leap high and far to catch animals in tall grass.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of these adaptations help Nigeria’s plants and animals live safely and find what they need in their environment.</p>
