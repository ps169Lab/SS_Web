            <h1>Nigeria's Wildlife</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Nigeria has many different environments, like swamps, forests, and savannahs. Because the land and weather can change a lot, plants and animals have special adaptations that help them survive.</p>
<h2>Staying Safe from Heat and Dryness</h2>
<p>Some plants in Nigeria have adaptations that help them survive long, hot dry seasons. Trees like Red Ironwood Tree and the Shea Tree can live for months with little water and can even survive wildfires in the savannah. These adaptations help them stay alive when the weather is very dry. Many of the plants and trees in the Savannah are built to survive extra heat and long periods without rain. </p>

<h2>Living in Water</h2>
<p>Many animals in Nigeria are adapted to life in rivers, lakes, and swamps. The common hippopotamus has eyes, ears, and nostrils high on its head so it can stay mostly underwater while still seeing, hearing, and breathing. Hippos also make a natural red “sunscreen” to protect their skin. The African manatee is another large animal that is built for swimming and living in the water. Many animals that live in the water have webbed feet which helps them be powerful swimmers - this helps them hunt fish to eat. </p>

<h2>Seeing at Night</h2>
<p>Some animals survive by being active at night, when it is safer and cooler. The Senegal bushbaby is a small animal with very large eyes that help it see in the dark as it jumps from tree to tree. These nighttime adaptations help it find food and stay safe from predators. Many animals that are active at night have extra strong senses of smell, hearing, and large eyes to help know what's going on around them in the dark. They sleep during the day to save energy, because they don't have to be awake when it's really hot out. </p>

<h2>Finding Food</h2>
<p>Other animals have body parts that help them hunt or search for food. The aardvark has a long nose for sniffing insects underground and can fold its ears back to keep dirt out while digging. The giraffe uses it's long neck to get food that is too high for other animals. And The leopard hunts by hiding and then running very fast—up to 58 km/h—to catch its prey. The serval, another wild cat, has long legs that help it leap high and far to catch animals in tall grass.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of these adaptations help Nigeria’s plants and animals live safely and find what they need in their environment.</p>
