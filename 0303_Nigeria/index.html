            <h2>
                Why Study Nigeria?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Learning about Nigeria helps us understand how geography affects the way people live. Nigeria's location near the equator gives it a warm climate all year long. Its rivers provide water for farming and transportation. Its forests provide materials for building and art-making.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nigeria is also important because it shows us how people from many different ethnic groups can live together in one country. Nigeria has over 500 different languages and many different cultural traditions, all sharing the same land and working together to build their nation.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Connecting Geography and Culture
            </h2>

            <p>
                As you read through these lessons, you'll see how Nigeria's natural resources and climate have influenced its people's culture. The clay from riverbanks becomes beautiful pottery. The forests provide wood for sculptures and building materials. The warm climate affects the types of houses people build and the clothes they wear.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each lesson will help you understand how the people of Nigeria have used their natural environment to create a rich and diverse culture. From the bronze artists of Benin to the textile weavers of the north, Nigerians have always found creative ways to use the resources around them.
