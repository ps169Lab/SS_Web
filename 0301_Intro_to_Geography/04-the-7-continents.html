                What is a Continent?
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                A continent is a very large area of land that is surrounded by water. Think of continents as giant islands, but much, much bigger than any regular island you might know. Our planet Earth has seven continents, and each one is special and unique in its own way.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seven continents are like seven different worlds on our one planet. Each continent has its own countries, people, animals, plants, and ways of life. Some continents are hot, some are cold, some have lots of people, and some have very few people living there.
            </p>

                The Seven Continents of Earth
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The largest continent is Asia, where countries like China, India, and Japan are located. Asia is home to more people than any other continent. North America is where we live - it includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico. South America is below North America and includes countries like Brazil and Argentina.
            </p>

            <p>
                Africa is a continent known for its amazing animals like lions, elephants, and giraffes. Europe is where countries like England, France, and Germany are found. Australia is both a continent and a country at the same time, and it's famous for unique animals like kangaroos and koalas.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Antarctica - The Coldest Continent
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Antarctica is the seventh continent, and it's very different from all the others. It's located at the very bottom of Earth, around the South Pole. Antarctica is covered in ice and snow all year long, and it's so cold that no people live there permanently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though Antarctica is too cold for people to live there, it's home to penguins, seals, and whales. Scientists from around the world visit Antarctica to study the ice and learn about our planet's weather and climate.
            </p>

            <!-- Additional content paragraphs -->
            <h2>
                What Makes Each Continent Special?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Each continent has its own special features that make it different from the others. Some continents have tall mountains, while others have flat grasslands. Some have hot deserts, while others have thick forests. Some continents have many different countries, while others have just a few.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The people living on each continent have developed their own cultures, languages, foods, and traditions. This means that traveling from one continent to another is like discovering completely new ways of living and seeing the world.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Oceans Between the Continents
            </h2>

            <p>
                The continents are separated by huge bodies of water called oceans. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean and separates Asia from North America. The Atlantic Ocean sits between North America and Europe. The Indian Ocean is between Africa and Asia.
            </p>

            <p>
                These oceans are so big that it takes many hours to fly across them in an airplane. Long ago, people had to sail across these oceans in ships, which took weeks or even months. Today, we can travel between continents much faster, but the oceans are still enormous barriers between the land areas.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Why Learning About Continents Matters
            </h2>

            <p>
                Understanding the seven continents helps us make sense of our world. When we hear news from different countries, we can picture where those places are located. When we learn about different animals, we can understand why polar bears live near the North Pole while penguins live in Antarctica.
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning about continents also helps us appreciate how big and diverse our world is. Each continent offers something unique and wonderful to discover. From the pyramids in Africa to the Great Wall in Asia, from the Amazon rainforest in South America to the Northern Lights in North America, every continent has amazing places and stories to explore.
