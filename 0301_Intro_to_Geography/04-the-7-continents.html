                What is a Continent?
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                A continent is defined as a very large area of land. On a globe, continents are among the easiest features to identify. Our planet Earth is divided into seven continents. They are larger than individual countries and contain various types of land and water.
            </p>

            <p>
                The seven continents, listed from largest to smallest, are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. It is worth noting that some people consider Europe and Asia to be a single continent called Eurasia.

            <h2>What Makes Each Continent Special?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Each continent has special things that make it different, like weather, land, and people. Geographers are like detectives who discover information about these "cool places on Earth".
            </p>

            <h3>Asia</h3>
            <p>
                Asia is the largest continent, covering one-third of all the land on Earth. It is home to a huge number of the world's people - two-thirds of everyone lives there in 48 countries. Asia includes China and India, which have the most people of any countries in the world. It has the world's highest mountain, the Himalayas, and the highest flat area, the Tibetan Plateau. It is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.

            <h3>Africa</h3>
            <p>
                Africa is the second largest continent, located between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. It has 54 different countries, which is more than any other continent. Africa is home to the world's longest river, the Nile, in the east, and the world's largest desert, the Sahara, in the northern part. It is known for its great variety of plants and animals, including many wild animals like lions, elephants, zebras, and rhinos. It tends to be very warm.

            <h3>North America</h3>
            <p>
                North America is the world's third largest continent. It touches the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, and the North Pacific Ocean to the west. It has 23 different countries, including the USA, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. North America has natural wonders such as Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon. The Panama Canal, which people built, separates it from South America.

            <h3>South America</h3>
            <p>
                South America is the world's fourth largest continent. It touches the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the north and east. North America and the Caribbean Sea are to its northwest. It has 12 independent countries, some of which are famous for their soccer teams, like Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. South America is home to the Amazon River rainforest, the world's driest desert (Atacama), and the world's longest mountain range (the Andes). It has unique animals such as capybara, llamas, and anacondas.

            <h3>Antarctica</h3>
            <p>
                Antarctica is the fifth largest continent, located at the South Pole and is almost completely covered in ice. It has very cold temperatures, which can drop way below freezing. Even though it's so cold, it is home to different types of animals such as seals and sea birds. No people live there permanently, though scientists visit to study. The ice here makes the area even colder by bouncing the sun's light and heat back into space. It is an icy continent with very little plant and animal life.

            <h3>Europe</h3>
            <p>
                Europe is the second smallest continent. It has nearly 51 independent countries with many different groups of people and languages. Its western coast touches the Atlantic Ocean, and it is separated from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea in the south. The European part of Russia is larger than any other country in Europe. Vatican City is the smallest country not only in Europe but also in the world. It lies across the Atlantic Ocean from North America and is known for its many old castles and stories about knights.

            <h3>Australia</h3>
            <p>
                Australia is special because it is both a country and a continent. When New Zealand, New Guinea, and other islands are included, it is also called Australasia or Oceania. It sits between the Indian Ocean to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. Famous places include the Opera House in Sydney, the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, and the Great Ocean Road in Victoria. It is the only continent that has just one country.

            <p>
                Understanding continents helps us learn about our planet and the world we live in.
