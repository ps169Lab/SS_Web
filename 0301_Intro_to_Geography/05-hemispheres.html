            </p>

            <h3>Northern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Northern Hemisphere includes everything north of the Equator. This hemisphere contains all of North America, most of Europe and Asia, and northern Africa. If you live in the United States, Canada, or most of Europe, you live in the Northern Hemisphere.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Northern Hemisphere is everything north of the Equator. It has North America, most of Europe and Asia, and northern Africa. If you live in the United States or Canada, you live here.</span>
            </p>

            <h3>Southern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Southern Hemisphere includes everything south of the Equator. This hemisphere contains most of South America and Africa, all of Australia, and Antarctica. Countries like Brazil, Australia, and South Africa are in the Southern Hemisphere.</span>

            <h3>Western Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere is the half west of the Prime Meridian. This hemisphere includes North and South America. The Prime Meridian is an imaginary line that passes through Greenwich, England, and helps us divide the Earth into eastern and western halves.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Western Hemisphere is the half west of the Prime Meridian. It has North and South America. The Prime Meridian is an invisible line through England that splits Earth into east and west halves.</span>

            <h3>Eastern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Eastern Hemisphere is the half east of the Prime Meridian. This hemisphere includes most of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Many of the world's oldest civilizations developed in the Eastern Hemisphere.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Eastern Hemisphere is the half east of the Prime Meridian. It has most of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Many old civilizations started here.</span>

            <h2>Why Hemispheres Matter</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Understanding hemispheres helps us describe where places are located on Earth. It also helps us understand different seasons, weather patterns, and how people live in different parts of the world. For example, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Understanding hemispheres helps us tell where places are on Earth. It helps us understand seasons and weather. For example, when it's winter up north, it's summer down south.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Hemispheres are one of the important tools that geographers use to organize and understand our world. They help us see the big picture of how our planet is arranged and how different regions relate to each other.</span>
