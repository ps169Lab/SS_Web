            <p>
                A hemisphere is like cutting the Earth in half. Just like you can cut an apple in half, we can imagine dividing the Earth into different halves to help us understand where places are located on our planet.
            </p>

            <h2>The Four Main Hemispheres</h2><div><img src="https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/4N61K1lKOJ/earth-hemispheres.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></div>
            
            <p>
                There are four main hemispheres that help us describe locations on Earth:
            </p>

            <h3>Northern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Northern Hemisphere includes everything north of the Equator. This hemisphere contains all of North America, most of Europe and Asia, and northern Africa. If you live in the United States, Canada, or most of Europe, you live in the Northern Hemisphere.
            </p>

            <h3>Southern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Southern Hemisphere includes everything south of the Equator. This hemisphere contains most of South America and Africa, all of Australia, and Antarctica. Countries like Brazil, Australia, and South Africa are in the Southern Hemisphere.
            </p>

            <h3>Western Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Western Hemisphere is the half west of the Prime Meridian. This hemisphere includes North and South America. The Prime Meridian is an imaginary line that passes through Greenwich, England, and helps us divide the Earth into eastern and western halves.
            </p>

            <h3>Eastern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
                The Eastern Hemisphere is the half east of the Prime Meridian. This hemisphere includes most of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Many of the world's oldest civilizations developed in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>

            <h2>Why Hemispheres Matter</h2>

            <p>
                Understanding hemispheres helps us describe where places are located on Earth. It also helps us understand different seasons, weather patterns, and how people live in different parts of the world. For example, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

            <p>
                Hemispheres are one of the important tools that geographers use to organize and understand our world. They help us see the big picture of how our planet is arranged and how different regions relate to each other.
