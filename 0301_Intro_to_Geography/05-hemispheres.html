                A hemisphere is exactly half of a sphere. Since Earth is shaped like a giant ball, we can divide it into different halves called hemispheres. Think of cutting an orange in half - each half would be a hemisphere of that orange.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earth has four hemispheres that help us describe where places are located. These hemispheres are created by two imaginary lines that circle our planet. Understanding hemispheres helps geographers and people all over the world talk about locations in the same way.

                The Four Hemispheres of Earth
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The equator is an imaginary line that goes around the middle of Earth from east to west. It divides our planet into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Everything above the equator is in the Northern Hemisphere, and everything below it is in the Southern Hemisphere.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Prime Meridian is another imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It divides Earth into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. Places to the east of this line are in the Eastern Hemisphere, and places to the west are in the Western Hemisphere.
            </p>

                Where Do We Live?
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                The United States, including New York where we live, is located in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. This means we are north of the equator and west of the Prime Meridian. Countries like Australia are in the Southern Hemisphere, which is why their seasons are opposite to ours.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it's winter here in New York, it's actually summer in Australia because they are in the Southern Hemisphere. This happens because different hemispheres receive sunlight at different angles throughout the year.

            <h2>
                Fun Facts About Hemispheres
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Most of the world's land is located in the Northern Hemisphere, while most of the world's water is in the Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere contains about 90% of all people on Earth, including everyone in North America, Europe, and most of Asia.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Understanding hemispheres helps us learn about different climates, seasons, and cultures around the world. It also helps us understand why some places are hot when others are cold, and why different parts of the world have different weather patterns.
            </p>

            <h2>
                How Hemispheres Help Us
            </h2>

            <p>
                Hemispheres give us a simple way to describe large areas of our planet. Instead of naming every single country, we can say "Northern Hemisphere" to talk about a huge area that includes many countries. This makes it easier to study weather patterns, animal migration, and other things that happen across large parts of Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning about hemispheres helps us become better global citizens. We can understand why people in different parts of the world might have different experiences with seasons, daylight, and weather, all based on which hemisphere they call home.
