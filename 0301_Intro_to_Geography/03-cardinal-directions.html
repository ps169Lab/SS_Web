            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Cardinal directions are important tools that help us understand and find our way around our world. There are FOUR Cardinal Directions: North (which means up), South (down), East (right), and West (left). They are very important for reading maps, exploring new places, and finding our way around.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Cardinal directions help us find our way around the world. There are four directions: North (up), South (down), East (right), and West (left). They help us read maps and explore new places.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">North is considered the "boss" of all directions, where the North Pole and Arctic are located. South is directly opposite North, where you find the South Pole. East is the direction where the sun rises in the morning. West is the direction where the sun sets in the evening.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">North is the most important direction. It's where the North Pole is. South is opposite of North. That's where the South Pole is. East is where the sun comes up. West is where the sun goes down.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">North and South are opposite each other, and East and West are also opposite. Besides the four main cardinal directions, there are also in-between directions: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest.</span>
