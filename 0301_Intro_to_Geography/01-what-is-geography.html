            <h2>What is Geography and How Does it Help Us?</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Geography is the study of Earth and how people live on it. Studying geography teaches us about our planet and the world we live in. It helps us learn about different places like continents, countries, oceans, rivers, deserts, and mountains. This year, we're going to learn what all of those words mean. Geography also explains why weather is different in different places and how weather and other things in a place make each spot on Earth special!</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Geography also teaches us about the different ways people around the world eat, dress, and play. This year, we'll learn about different languages, holidays, music, and the art that people make. We'll also learn the amazing stories that happened in the past, and how those stories shaped how people act today! Earth is always changing, and we will see how all of those changes add up to the way that we and people in other parts of the world live now.</span>

            <h2>Tools that Help Geographers</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Geographers are like detectives to discover clues about our world. They use certain tools to help them. They use maps, which are drawings that show where things are in the world, like a picture from high above. When we learn how to read different maps, you will see that there is so much we can learn from them. Every map tells a story!</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Other important tools include globes, which are round models of the Earth, and compasses that help us find our way by always pointing North. GPS uses satellites in space to help us find out where we are and get from one place to another without getting lost.</span>

                <span class="easy-reading">Geography has five big ideas about our planet:</span>
            </p>

            <ul>
