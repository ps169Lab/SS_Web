                <span class="standard-reading">The first great civilization in the Americas was the Olmec, who lived from about 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. The Olmec are sometimes called the "Mother Culture of Mesoamerica" because they influenced all the civilizations that came after them.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Olmec built the first cities in the Americas, with large stone buildings and plazas where thousands of people could gather. They are famous for carving enormous stone heads, some weighing as much as 40 tons. These giant heads show the faces of Olmec rulers and are among the most amazing artworks ever created in the ancient Americas.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Most importantly, the Olmec developed one of the first writing systems in the Americas. They created hieroglyphs - pictures and symbols that represented words and ideas. This was a huge step forward because it meant they could record their history, laws, and knowledge instead of just passing them down by word of mouth.</span>
