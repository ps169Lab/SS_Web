                <span class="standard-reading">Imagine living where it is winter all year long! The Arctic is the coldest region in the Western Hemisphere. It covers the far northern parts of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Here, temperatures can drop far below freezing, and the ground stays frozen most of the year. Snow and ice cover the land for many months.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Even in this harsh, cold environment, Native American tribes found ways to survive and thrive. The main groups who lived in the Arctic were the Inuit, Aleut, and Yupik peoples. These amazing people learned to use everything the cold land and icy seas could give them.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Arctic tribes could not grow crops because the ground was too cold and frozen. Instead, they became expert hunters and fishers. They had to be very skilled to find food in such a difficult place.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">People who lived near the ocean hunted sea mammals like seals, walruses, and whales. Seals were especially important because they provided meat for food, oil for lamps, and skins for clothing and boats. The Inuit would wait patiently by holes in the ice where seals came up to breathe. When a seal appeared, they would quickly spear it.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Tribes who lived inland hunted caribou, which are large deer that travel in huge herds across the frozen land. They also hunted moose and caught fish through holes in the ice. Arctic people learned to preserve their food by drying it or storing it in the cold.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Arctic tribes built different types of homes depending on the season and their needs. In summer, they lived in tents made from animal skins stretched over wooden frames. These tents could be taken apart and moved when the tribe needed to follow the animals they hunted.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">In winter, some groups built igloos, which are dome-shaped houses made entirely from blocks of snow. Even though they were made of snow, igloos were surprisingly warm inside. The body heat from the people living inside, along with oil lamps, could keep the temperature comfortable even when it was freezing cold outside.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Living in the Arctic required special tools that could work in the cold and help people hunt on ice and water. Arctic tribes made kayaks, which are small, fast boats covered in waterproof seal skin. These boats were perfect for hunting seals and whales in icy waters.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">They also made sleds pulled by teams of strong dogs. These sled dogs could travel across snow and ice much faster than people could walk. The dogs were not just helpers - they were important family members who helped Arctic people travel and hunt.</span>
