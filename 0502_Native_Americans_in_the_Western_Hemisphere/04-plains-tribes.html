                The Great Plains - A Sea of Grass
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                The Great Plains stretched across the middle of North America like a huge sea of grass. This region covered parts of what is now the United States and Canada, from Saskatchewan in the north all the way south to Texas. Instead of forests or mountains, the Plains were mostly flat grasslands that seemed to go on forever.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Plains had hot summers and cold winters, with strong winds that blew across the open land. There were few trees, except along rivers and streams. But this grassland was perfect for huge herds of buffalo - millions and millions of these large, shaggy animals that became the center of Plains Indian life.
            </p>

                The Buffalo - Everything They Needed
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                For Plains tribes like the Lakota, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and Comanche, the buffalo was the most important animal in their world. These massive herds provided almost everything the Plains people needed to survive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Buffalo meat was their main food. The women would cut the meat into strips and dry it in the sun to make jerky that would last for months. They also made pemmican by mixing dried meat with fat and berries - this was like an energy bar that hunters could carry on long trips.
            </p>

            <p>
                But Plains tribes used much more than just the meat. Buffalo hides became clothing, blankets, and the covers for their homes. Buffalo bones were carved into tools, needles, and weapons. Even buffalo hair was twisted into rope, and buffalo horns became cups and spoons. The Plains people had a saying: "The buffalo gives us everything we need."

                Tipis - Homes That Could Move
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Because Plains tribes followed the buffalo herds as they moved across the grasslands, they needed homes that could be taken apart and moved quickly. They invented the tipi, a cone-shaped tent made from long wooden poles covered with buffalo hides.
            </p>

            <p>
                A tipi was the perfect home for life on the Plains. It could be set up or taken down in just a few minutes by the women of the tribe. The cone shape was strong enough to stand up to the powerful winds that swept across the open grasslands. In winter, a small fire in the center kept the tipi warm, and the smoke escaped through an opening at the top.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each tipi could house a family of six to eight people. The floor was covered with soft buffalo robes, and the family's belongings were stored in decorated bags called parfleches, which were made from buffalo hide.

                The Horse Changes Everything
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                For thousands of years, Plains tribes hunted buffalo on foot, which was very difficult and dangerous. Then, in the 1600s and 1700s, something amazing happened that changed Plains life forever - they got horses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Horses had been brought to America by Spanish explorers. Some horses escaped or were traded to Native Americans, and slowly, horses spread north across the Plains. By the 1700s, most Plains tribes had learned to ride and use horses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Horses made Plains tribes much better buffalo hunters. Mounted on fast horses, hunters could ride alongside the buffalo herds and shoot arrows at close range. This was much safer and more successful than hunting on foot. Horses also made it easier to move camps and carry belongings across the vast grasslands.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Hunting the Great Herds
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Plains tribes developed clever ways to hunt buffalo. Before they had horses, they would sometimes drive entire herds over cliffs or into box canyons where the animals couldn't escape. They also used fire to control where the herds would go.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once they had horses, Plains warriors became some of the best riders in the world. They could shoot arrows accurately while riding at full speed. Some hunters could even hang off the side of their horse to get a better shot at a buffalo.
            </p>

            <p>
                Buffalo hunting was dangerous work. These animals were huge - a full-grown buffalo could weigh as much as a small car. But Plains hunters were brave and skillful, and they knew that their families depended on successful hunts.

                Two Ways of Life on the Plains
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Not all Plains tribes lived exactly the same way. There were two main groups: the nomadic tribes and the village tribes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nomadic tribes like the Lakota and Cheyenne followed the buffalo herds all year long. They lived in tipis and moved their camps whenever the herds moved. These tribes became famous for their horse-riding skills and their warrior culture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Village tribes like the Mandan and Pawnee lived in permanent villages along rivers. They built earth lodges - round houses made from wooden frames covered with grass and dirt. These tribes grew crops like corn, beans, and squash, but they also went on seasonal buffalo hunts.
            </p>

                Plains Culture and Traditions
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Plains tribes developed a rich culture centered around the buffalo and the horse. They created beautiful art on their tipis, clothing, and weapons. They painted pictures that told stories of great hunts and brave deeds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Plains tribes also developed a special sign language that let different tribes communicate even if they spoke different languages. This was very useful when tribes met to trade or during large gatherings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many Plains tribes held Sun Dances, which were important religious ceremonies where people danced and prayed for the health and success of their tribe. These ceremonies could last for several days and brought tribes together from across the Plains.

                The End of the Buffalo Era
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Plains Indian way of life lasted for hundreds of years, but it began to change in the 1800s when European-American settlers moved west. The biggest change came when the great buffalo herds were hunted almost to extinction by commercial hunters who sold the hides and left the meat to rot on the Plains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Without the buffalo, Plains tribes could no longer live their traditional nomadic lifestyle. This was one of the greatest tragedies in Native American history, as it destroyed a way of life that had worked successfully for centuries.

            <p>
                Plains tribes created one of the most successful hunting cultures in human history. They learned to live in perfect harmony with the buffalo herds and the grassland environment. Their skills as riders, hunters, and survivors on the open Plains were legendary. Though their traditional way of life was disrupted, Plains tribes showed incredible adaptability and strength in learning to thrive in one of the world's most challenging environments.
