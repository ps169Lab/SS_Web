                Life in the Eastern Woodlands
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                The Eastern Woodlands covered much of what is now the eastern United States and parts of Canada. This region was filled with thick forests of oak, maple, pine, and birch trees. Rivers and streams flowed through the woods, and there were many lakes. The climate had four seasons - cold winters, warm summers, and mild springs and falls.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many Native American tribes made their homes in these forests. Some of the most well-known were the Iroquois, Cherokee, Algonquian peoples, and many others. These forest tribes learned to use the trees, plants, and animals of the woodland to create everything they needed for daily life.

                The Three Sisters - A Smart Way to Farm
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes discovered one of the smartest farming methods ever invented. They grew corn, beans, and squash together in the same field. They called these crops the "Three Sisters" because the plants helped each other grow, just like sisters help each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's how it worked: The corn grew tall and strong, giving the bean plants something to climb up. The beans took nitrogen from the air and put it in the soil, which helped the corn and squash grow better. The squash plants spread out on the ground with their big leaves, keeping weeds away and holding moisture in the soil.
            </p>

            <p>
                This clever farming method meant that forest tribes could grow lots of food in small spaces. They could stay in one place instead of moving around to hunt and gather food. This allowed them to build permanent villages and develop complex societies.

            <h2>
                Homes Built from the Forest
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes built their homes using materials from the woods around them. They made two main types of houses: wigwams and longhouses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wigwams were round houses made by bending young tree branches into a dome shape and covering them with bark, animal skins, or woven mats. These homes were perfect for smaller families and could be built quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Longhouses were much bigger - sometimes over 100 feet long! They were made from wooden poles covered with elm bark. Many related families lived together in one longhouse, with each family having their own section. A longhouse might have 20 or more people living in it. Fires for cooking and warmth were built down the middle, with smoke holes in the roof.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Using Every Part of the Forest
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes were experts at using everything the woodland provided. They made canoes by hollowing out large tree trunks or by stretching birchbark over wooden frames. These canoes let them travel quickly on rivers and lakes to trade, hunt, and visit other tribes.
            </p>

            <p>
                They used different types of wood for different purposes. Hard woods like oak were used for tools and weapons. Soft woods like pine were easier to carve. Birchbark was especially useful - it was waterproof and could be made into containers, baskets, and even writing material.
            </p>

            <p>
                Forest tribes also gathered wild foods from the woods. They collected nuts, berries, maple syrup, and wild rice. They hunted deer, bears, rabbits, and birds. They caught fish from streams and lakes using spears, nets, and hooks made from bone.

                Trading and Wampum
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes were great traders who exchanged goods with tribes from far away. They made beautiful wampum belts from purple and white shell beads. These belts were not just pretty decorations - they were like money that could be traded for other goods. Wampum belts also told important stories and recorded agreements between tribes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through trading, forest tribes got copper from the Great Lakes region, shells from the ocean, and other materials they couldn't find in their own forests. This trading created connections between tribes across huge distances.

                The Iroquois League
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                One of the most important developments in the Eastern Woodlands was the Iroquois League, also called the Haudenosaunee. This was a union of five tribes (later six) who agreed to work together instead of fighting each other. The tribes were the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca, with the Tuscarora joining later.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Iroquois League had a government where representatives from each tribe met to make decisions that affected all the tribes. This was one of the first democratic governments in North America, and it influenced the founders of the United States when they created the American government.

                Forest Ceremonies and Beliefs
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes had many ceremonies to celebrate the changing seasons and give thanks for the gifts of nature. They held special ceremonies when they planted crops in spring, when the crops were ready to harvest in fall, and during the winter months.
            </p>

            <p>
                They made beautiful masks for ceremonies, often carved from wood and decorated with paint, feathers, and other natural materials. These masks represented spirits of animals, plants, and natural forces that were important to forest life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Forest tribes also created dreamcatchers - circular frames with woven webs inside, decorated with feathers and beads. They believed dreamcatchers would catch bad dreams and let good dreams pass through to sleeping children.

                Masters of the Woodland
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Forest tribes showed amazing skill in learning to live in harmony with the woodland environment. They developed sustainable farming methods, built comfortable homes from forest materials, and created complex societies. Their innovations like the Three Sisters farming method and democratic government systems continue to influence people today. They proved that humans can live successfully in forests while taking care of the environment for future generations.
