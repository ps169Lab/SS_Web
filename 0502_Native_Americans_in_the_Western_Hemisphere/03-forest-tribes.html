                <span class="standard-reading">The Eastern Woodlands covered much of what is now the eastern United States and parts of Canada. This region was filled with thick forests of oak, maple, pine, and birch trees. Rivers and streams flowed through the woods, and there were many lakes. The climate had four seasons - cold winters, warm summers, and mild springs and falls.</span>

                The Three Sisters - A Smart Way to Farm

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Forest tribes discovered one of the smartest farming methods ever invented. They grew corn, beans, and squash together in the same field. They called these crops the "Three Sisters" because the plants helped each other grow, just like sisters help each other.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Here's how it worked: The corn grew tall and strong, giving the bean plants something to climb up. The beans took nitrogen from the air and put it in the soil, which helped the corn and squash grow better. The squash plants spread out on the ground with their big leaves, keeping weeds away and holding moisture in the soil.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">This clever farming method meant that forest tribes could grow lots of food in small spaces. They could stay in one place instead of moving around to hunt and gather food. This allowed them to build permanent villages and develop complex societies.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Wigwams were round houses made by bending young tree branches into a dome shape and covering them with bark, animal skins, or woven mats. These homes were perfect for smaller families and could be built quickly.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Longhouses were much bigger - sometimes over 100 feet long! They were made from wooden poles covered with elm bark. Many related families lived together in one longhouse, with each family having their own section. A longhouse might have 20 or more people living in it. Fires for cooking and warmth were built down the middle, with smoke holes in the roof.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Forest tribes were experts at using everything the woodland provided.

                <span class="standard-reading">They used different types of wood for different purposes. Hard woods like oak were used for tools and weapons. Soft woods like pine were easier to carve. Birchbark was especially useful - it was waterproof and could be made into containers, baskets, and even writing material.</span>
