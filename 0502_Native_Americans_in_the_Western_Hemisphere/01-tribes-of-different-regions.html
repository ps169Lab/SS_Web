The Western Hemisphere includes North America, Central America, and South America. These first people arrived thousands of years ago by walking across a land bridge from Asia to Alaska.</span>

Others lived in hot deserts in the southwest. Some made their homes in thick forests, while others lived on wide, grassy plains. Each group had to learn how to live in their special environment.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Native American tribes were very smart about using what nature gave them. They learned to adapt, which means they changed the way they lived to fit their environment. If they lived where it was very cold, they learned to make warm clothes and shelters. If they lived in the desert, they found ways to get water and grow food in dry places.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">At first, most Native Americans were hunter-gatherers. This means they hunted wild animals for meat and gathered wild plants, nuts, and berries for food. They moved around a lot to find food. Over time, many groups learned how to grow their own food through agriculture. When they could grow their own crops, they could stay in one place and build permanent villages.</span>
