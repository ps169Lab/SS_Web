                <span class="standard-reading">All Native American tribes in the Western Hemisphere started from the same place. Thousands of years ago, the first people walked across a land bridge from Asia to Alaska. From there, they spread out across North America, Central America, and South America. As these groups moved to different places with different climates and resources, they developed their own unique ways of life.</span>

                Deep Respect for Nature
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">All Native American tribes had a deep connection to the natural world around them. They believed that humans were part of nature, not separate from it. They understood that they needed to take care of the land, water, plants, and animals if they wanted these resources to last for their children and grandchildren.</span>

            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">This respect for nature meant that Native Americans used resources in sustainable ways. They took only what they needed and found ways to use every part of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. They understood that wasting natural resources would hurt their ability to survive.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">All Native American tribes preserved their history, knowledge, and beliefs through oral traditions.

                <span class="standard-reading">All Native American tribes made their tools, weapons, clothing, and homes from natural materials found in their environment. They used wood, stone, bone, animal skins, plant fibers, and clay to create everything they needed for daily life.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">All Native American tribes valued strong family and community connections.

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The biggest differences between tribes came from how they found and produced food. Arctic tribes hunted seals and caribou but couldn't grow crops in the frozen ground. Plains tribes followed buffalo herds across grasslands. Forest tribes grew the Three Sisters crops and gathered nuts and berries. Desert tribes developed irrigation systems to grow crops with little water. Rainforest tribes cleared jungle areas to create farmland.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">These different food sources led to very different ways of life. Some tribes moved constantly to follow animals, while others stayed in permanent villages to tend their crops.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Native American tribes built very different types of homes based on their environment and lifestyle. Arctic tribes built igloos from snow and skin tents. Plains tribes lived in tipis that could be moved easily. Forest tribes built wigwams and longhouses from wood and bark. Desert tribes constructed adobe pueblos from clay. Each type of home was perfectly designed for its environment.</span>
