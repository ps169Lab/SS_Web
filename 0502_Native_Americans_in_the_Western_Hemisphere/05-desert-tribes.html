These areas, including parts of what is now Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and northern Mexico, received very little rain each year.

                <span class="standard-reading">Water was the most precious resource in the desert, and desert tribes became experts at finding and saving every drop. They learned where to dig wells to reach underground water. They built systems of ditches and canals to bring water from rivers and streams to their crops. This method of bringing water to plants is called irrigation.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Desert tribes developed special ways to grow crops in their dry environment.

                <span class="standard-reading">Some tribes practiced "dry farming," which meant growing crops without irrigation by choosing the right places to plant and storing rainwater in the soil.
