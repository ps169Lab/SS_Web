            <h2>How Continental Drift Works</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Slowly, slowly, over many, many millions of years, these enormous land pieces started to drift apart. This slow movement is what scientists call continental drift. It happened because the Earth's outside layer is made of huge, slowly moving rock slabs called tectonic plates. Think of them like rafts floating on a very thick, gooey liquid deep inside the Earth!</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Around 200 million years ago, Pangaea began to crack and split into two big pieces: Laurasia was the northern part, and Gondwana was the southern part.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">For a very long time, North America and South America were separate landmasses with a big ocean gap between them. But then, something amazing happened! About 15 million years ago, big underwater movements caused volcanoes to erupt, and these volcanoes started forming islands where Central America is today.</span>

            <h2>The Great American Connection</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Over time, more land was created by these volcanoes, and eroded dirt and rocks from both North and South America filled in the spaces between the islands. Finally, around three million years ago, North America and South America became connected by a narrow strip of land called the Isthmus of Panama.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">This was like building a bridge between the two big continents! Once they were connected, many animals and plants could walk or spread between the two continents, in an event called the "Great American Interchange".</span>

            <h2>How Scientists Know This Happened</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Scientists know about this amazing journey by studying clues like fossils. When they find the same kinds of fossils on continents that are now very far apart, like a small reptile called Mesosaurus whose fossils are only in South America and southern Africa, it tells us those lands must have been connected long ago. Since this little creature couldn't swim across a whole ocean, it's strong evidence that these lands were once together.</span>
