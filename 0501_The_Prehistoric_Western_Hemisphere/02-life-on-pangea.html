            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>Life on Pangaea was very different and full of amazing plants and animals. Around this huge land was a giant ocean called Panthalassa, filled with interesting sea creatures.</p><p></p><img src="https://cdn.sci.news/images/2015/04/image_2663f-End-Triassic-Mass-Extinction.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><h2>Life in the Ocean</h2><p>In Panthalassa, there were creatures like ammonites with swirly shells, soft mollusks, and spiky sea urchins. Giant sea reptiles called ichthyosaurs (which looked like dolphins) and long-necked plesiosaurs swam in these waters.</p><p></p><img src="https://hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/header-ammonites.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><h2>Animals on Land</h2><p>On Pangaea’s land, near water, animals like frogs, salamanders, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes lived. Flying in the sky were pterosaurs, reptiles with wings that soared high. During the Triassic Period, when Pangaea began to split, new life started to grow: the first tiny mammals and early dinosaurs appeared. Dinosaurs soon became the biggest land animals.</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Th15yutVZ68kgCIGGqH189rcriXyBEyhAQAIkI991Tor31bryjbs_9lUHruDqIxIMsdr-hQx3JlnS_xHtD0CSUvQlCx2dEw0yzUbqe4z_ISKuYDE-145Up5kUsykQsZT" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p><h2>Plants and Small Creatures</h2><p>The ground was covered with plants like mosses, ferns, and tall trees such as conifers and ginkgos. Small creatures like spiders, scorpions, millipedes, centipedes, and grasshoppers lived among these plants.</p><p><img src="https://www.waynesword.net/images/cycasd6b.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p><h2>Climate and Weather</h2><p>Because Pangaea was so big, its weather was different across the land. The middle parts, far from the ocean, were dry and cool, like a huge desert with big changes between hot and cold. Near the equator, there were wet, swampy places with heavy rains called monsoons that brought warm, moist air from the ocean. The land being all together helped dry-weather animals and plants spread easily.</p><p><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/the-future-is-wild/images/7/76/FIW_1x10_Desert_overview.png/revision/latest?cb=20181117042447" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p><h2>The Landscape</h2><p>Pangaea was shaped like a huge letter C stretching from the top of the Earth to the bottom. Down the middle were huge mountains called the Central Pangaean Mountains—very long and tall, like the tallest mountains today. These mountains blocked rain, making the center very dry and desert-like. The edges near the ocean were wetter and had lush swamps.</p><p><img src="https://databayou.com/pangea/images/pangea.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p><p>Pangaea’s world was very different from ours now, before the continents slowly drifted apart and before humans came to the Americas to live and create their own cultures.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
