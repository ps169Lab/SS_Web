            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere is defined as the part of the Earth that primarily encompasses North America and South America. It also includes surrounding waters and is sometimes considered to be bounded by longitudes 20°W and 160°E.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere is also commonly referred to as the Americas or the New World. The name "America" itself was first recorded in 1507 on a map by German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, referring initially to South America, and later extended to both continents.</span>

            <h2>What Makes Up the Western Hemisphere</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere comprises the totality of North America and South America. When viewed as a single continent, it is referred to as "the continent of America". North America occupies the northern portion of this landmass.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Western Hemisphere includes all of North America and South America. When seen as one continent, it is called "the continent of America". North America is the northern part of this landmass.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">It makes up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere. Its vast north-to-south extent, approximately 14,000 km (8,700 mi), leads to significant variations in climate and ecology, ranging from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">It makes up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere. Its huge north-to-south distance, about 14,000 km (8,700 mi), creates big differences in climate and nature, from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How the Western Hemisphere Formed</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere has an amazing geological history. Hundreds of millions of years ago, North America was joined with other modern continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea. When the parts of Pangaea began to separate around 200 million years ago, North and South America began to look the way that we see them today.</span>

            <h2>The Ice Ages and Early People</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">During glacial periods, such as the Wisconsin glaciation (50,000–17,000 years ago), falling sea levels exposed the Beringia land bridge, connecting Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska). This land bridge was largely unglaciated due to low snowfall and supported a cold, dry mammoth steppe environment, serving as an ecological refugium for plants and animals.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Western Hemisphere was home to notable fauna such as bison, black bear, jaguar, cougar, and various megafauna like mammoths and mastodons. The first humans in the Americas adapted to their environment as well as changed it through their interactions with their environment and the development of unique cultures.</span>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Understanding the Western Hemisphere helps us learn about how our continents formed, how early people came to live here, and how they adapted to different environments. The story of the Western Hemisphere is the story of how the Americas became home to many different cultures and peoples over thousands of years.</span>
