            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Scientists use archaeological and fossil evidence to learn about the earliest people in the Americas. The Clovis people has a lot of artifacts that scientists use to learn about early people. There are many archaeological sites which show evidence of humans living in the americas dating back thousands of years. Scientists use evidence to learn information about these people.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Scientists study old objects and bones to learn about the first people in America. The Clovis people left behind many things that help us understand how they lived.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Clovis people are not considered the earliest people in the Americas. For decades, scientists thought the "Clovis First" theory was correct, but now they know that other people lived in the Americas before the Clovis culture, between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Clovis people were not the first people in America. Scientists now know that other people lived here even earlier, about 20,000 years ago.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Evidence from the Clovis Site</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Clovis site, near Clovis, New Mexico, is where the Clovis culture was first discovered in the 1930s. The first evidence was found in 1929 by 19-year-old amateur archaeologist Ridgely Whiteman, who found fluted points associated with mammoth bones along Blackwater Draw.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Clovis site is in New Mexico. This is where scientists first found evidence of the Clovis people in the 1930s. A young man found special spear points with mammoth bones.</span>
            </p><p><img src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2017/kentstatearc.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The excavations uncovered ancient spearheads called Clovis points, stone tools, hearths, and evidence of almost continuous human occupation. These distinctive stone and bone tools are what the Clovis people are named after. Clovis points are special spear points with concave grooves down each side, sharp edges, and a lance-shaped tip.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Scientists found old spearheads called Clovis points, stone tools, and fire places. The Clovis people are named after these special spear points that have grooves on the sides.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>What the Evidence Shows</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The spear points were found directly with mammoth bones, showing that the Clovis people were skilled big-game hunters. Projectile points show impact scars from thrusting and throwing against hard bone, and stone tools display damage from butchering animals.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The spear points were found with mammoth bones, showing that the Clovis people were good at hunting big animals. The tools show marks from hitting bones and cutting up animals.</span>
            </p><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qW_A!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc122be27-7e80-4947-9e0d-24de8e22ec3e_4000x3000.jpeg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">From the artifacts, scientists learned that the Clovis people were nomadic, moving in search of food and living in crude shelters, tents, or shallow caves. They flourished on lush grasslands with megafauna such as mammoths, giant bison, dire wolves, camels, giant ground sloths, huge turtles, and saber-toothed tigers.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Clovis people moved from place to place looking for food. They lived in simple shelters, tents, or caves. They lived with huge animals like mammoths, giant bison, and saber-toothed tigers.</span>

            <h2>Pre-Clovis Evidence</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Many archaeological sites are now widely accepted as predating the Clovis culture. Key examples include Monte Verde II in Chile, dated to around 14,500 years ago, making it one of the oldest confirmed sites of human habitation in the Americas.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Scientists have found places where people lived before the Clovis people. One important place is Monte Verde in Chile, where people lived about 14,500 years ago.</span>
            </p>

                <span class="standard-reading">Other important sites include Paisley Caves in Oregon, where fossilized human remains with human DNA have been dated back 14,300 years, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania, which has evidence of continuous human habitation dating as far back as 19,000 or 16,000 years ago.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Other important places include caves in Oregon and Pennsylvania where people lived thousands of years ago, even before the Clovis people.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How Scientists Study the Evidence</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are primary evidence used by archaeologists to study early human activity. Genetic evidence from DNA links indigenous peoples of the Americas to Siberian populations, showing that the first Americans came from Asia.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Scientists study stone tools like spear points to learn about early people. DNA evidence shows that the first Americans came from Asia.</span>
            </p><p><img src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/769761/3.jpg?w=1200&amp;f=9a034c23178de45167db0ca8ed89c5ad" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The materials used to craft tools often came from distant areas, indicating that early inhabitants were either highly mobile or engaged in long-distance trade networks. This shows how the first humans in the Americas adapted to their environment and developed unique cultures through their interactions with their surroundings.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The materials for making tools came from far away places. This shows that early people either traveled a lot or traded with other groups far away.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">All this evidence helps scientists understand that people have been living in the Americas for much longer than once thought, and that they developed many different ways of life as they spread across the continents.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">All this evidence shows that people have been living in America for a very long time and developed many different ways of life.</span>
