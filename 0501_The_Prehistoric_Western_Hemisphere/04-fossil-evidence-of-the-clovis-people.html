One important group is the <strong>Clovis people</strong>,
 known for their unique stone tools found at sites across North America.
 But the Clovis people were not the very first to live here; people 
lived in the Americas even earlier, between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago.</p><p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><img src="https://www.crystalinks.com/clovispeople.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4" id="the-clovis-site">The Clovis Site</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The Clovis culture was first found near <strong>Clovis, New Mexico</strong> in the 1930s. A young archaeologist named Ridgely Whiteman discovered special spear points called <strong>Clovis points</strong>
 in 1929. These points had sharp edges and grooves on the sides and were
 used for hunting large animals like mammoths. Scientists also found 
stone tools, fire pits, and signs that people lived there for a long 
time.</p><p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><img src="https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/sn/clovis_first.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4" id="what-the-evidence-shows">What the Evidence Shows</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The
 Clovis people were good hunters who chased big animals. The spear 
points show marks from hitting and throwing at bones, and other tools 
had damage from cutting meat. They lived by moving around for food, 
living in simple shelters like tents or caves. They hunted mammoths, 
giant bison, saber-toothed tigers, and many other large animals.</p><p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/011522_bb_clovis_feat.jpg?resize=1440%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4" id="earlier-than-clovis">Earlier Than Clovis</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Scientists found many sites that are older than Clovis. For example, <strong>Monte Verde II</strong> in Chile dates back about 14,500 years, making it one of the earliest known human homes in the Americas. In Oregon, <strong>Paisley Caves</strong> have fossils with human DNA from about 14,300 years ago. In Pennsylvania, <strong>Meadowcroft Rockshelter</strong> shows evidence of people living there as early as 16,000 to 19,000 years ago.</p><p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><img src="https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/media/uploads/Ft._Rock_Cave_Cressman_Luther_at_bb004556_1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4" id="how-scientists-study-early-people">How Scientists Study Early People</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Stone
 tools like spear points and scrapers help archaeologists learn about 
early life. DNA shows a link between Native Americans and people from 
Siberia, proving the first Americans came from Asia. Some tool materials
 came from far away, meaning early people traveled a lot or traded with 
others.</p><p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1638886575/EducationHub/photos/picking-at-history.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">All
 this proof helps scientists understand that people have lived in the 
Americas much longer than they once thought. These early humans learned 
how to live and adapt in many different ways as they spread across the 
continents.</p></div>
