            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The earliest known inhabitants of the Americas are referred to as Paleo-Indians. Their daily lives were very difficult, but they were very resourceful and were able to adapt to their new environment and find ways to survive in an unfamiliar place.</span>
<span class="easy-reading">Let's learn about what their lives were like. </span></p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/U12qCpRRd-or915432EMdGo5YC4e8n3EXXuGdaTueEwHJttKePElcRnBk1IgDkzk9gLV2HKtMkJXJlIlwOX0ZwaF3tkUnsGola0lpwT2OkqxKZh0" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

            <p><span class="easy-reading">People first came to America from Asia about 20,000 years ago. This time is called the Lithic stage because people made stone tools.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How They Lived</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers. They typically lived in small, family-based groups called bands, which moved from place to place. This <b>nomadic</b> lifestyle was driven by the search for food. Their populations increased over time, which led some groups to have to move out of the areas they were in as they became more crowded.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Paleo-Indians hunted animals and gathered plants for food. So when a place became too crowded, or their was less food to hunt and gather, groups would split off from one another and one group would move to a new place. Over thousands of years, this is what caused Paleo-Indians to populate the whole hemisphere, from Northern Canada to the Southern tip of South America. </span></p><p><img src="https://tribaltradeco.com/cdn/shop/articles/hunting-gathering-caribou.jpg?v=1519162124" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Being nomadic, Paleo-Indians often lived in crude shelters, tents, or shallow caves. At the Monte Verde II site in Chile, archaeological findings show small rectangular shelters, about 65 feed long long, that were secured to the ground with wooden stakes.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Since they moved around a lot, Paleo-Indians lived in simple shelters, tents, or caves. Some built long houses that they held down with wooden stakes.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>What They Ate</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Their diet consisted of wild foods, including plants, nuts, game, and fish. They hunted megafauna, large animals of the Pleistocene era such as mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, musk-oxen, camels, and ancient reindeer.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">They ate wild plants, nuts, animals, and fish. They hunted very large animals like mammoths, giant bison, and ancient reindeer.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Evidence from sites like Gault (Texas) and Jake Bluff (Oklahoma) indicates they also consumed smaller animals and a wide variety of wild plant foods, including fruit, tubers, nuts, and even seaweed. In South America, Paleo-Indians collected plants and caught small game, including tropical forest fruits and nuts.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">They also ate smaller animals and many different plants, including fruits, nuts, and even seaweed. In South America, they ate tropical fruits and nuts.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How They Got Food</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">They primarily obtained food through hunting and gathering. These early peoples often followed herds of megafauna. Stone tools were crucial for their survival, particularly projectile points and scrapers. Projectile points, such as spear points, were typically made by chipping a single flake from each side of a stone and then attaching it to a wooden or bone shaft.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">As the climate changed and megafauna became scarcer, late Paleo-Indians adapted by relying on diverse subsistence methods, showing how they developed unique ways of surviving in different environments.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">When the weather changed and big animals became harder to find, Paleo-Indians learned new ways to get food and survive.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How They Changed Their Environment</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Early humans impacted their environment primarily through hunting large animals. The sheer number of bones at some kill sites suggests they were skilled big-game hunters. They also used fire to clear land for living and hunting, activities that shaped the landscape.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Evidence suggests that early humans burned Beringian landscapes as far back as 34,000 years ago, possibly as a method for hunting megafauna. This shows how the first humans in the Americas adapted to their environment as well as changed it through their interactions with their environment.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Early people used fire to burn land as long as 34,000 years ago, maybe to help them hunt big animals. This shows how they changed their environment.</span>

            <h2>Their Tools and Trade</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The materials used for crafting tools could originate from distant areas, implying long-distance travel or trade networks. For instance, at Meadowcroft Rockshelter, tools were made from materials found far from the site, showing that these early people were either highly mobile or had connections with other groups.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The materials for making tools came from far away places. This shows that early people either traveled long distances or traded with other groups.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The climate stabilized around 10,000 years ago, leading to advances in lithic technology and a more sedentary lifestyle, as well as an increase in population and established territories. This marked the beginning of the development of unique cultures that would eventually become the many different Native American tribes and nations we know today.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">About 10,000 years ago, the weather became more stable. People made better tools and stayed in one place more. This was the beginning of the many different Native American tribes we know today.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">These first Americans were remarkable people who successfully adapted to a completely new continent, developing the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in diverse environments from the Arctic to the tropics.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">These first Americans were amazing people who learned how to live in a new continent, from cold places in the north to warm places in the south.</span>
