                <span class="standard-reading">The first people to live in America are called Paleo-Indians. They came from Asia about 20,000 years ago during the Ice Age. Life was hard for them, but they were smart and learned how to survive in their new home.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">These early people made tools from stone, which is why this time period is sometimes called the Stone Age. They had to learn everything about living in America - what plants were safe to eat, which animals to hunt, and how to stay warm and dry.</span>

            <h2>How They Lived</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who lived in small family groups. They moved from place to place looking for food. This moving lifestyle is called being nomadic. When an area became crowded or food became hard to find, some families would move to new places.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Over thousands of years, this moving from place to place helped Paleo-Indians spread all across North and South America - from cold northern Canada all the way to the warm southern tip of South America.</span>

            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Since they moved around a lot, Paleo-Indians lived in simple shelters that were easy to build and take down. They used tents, stayed in caves, or built small houses. Some houses were long and narrow and were held to the ground with wooden stakes.</span>

            </p>

            <h2>What They Ate</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Paleo-Indians ate only wild foods - nothing was grown on farms yet. They ate wild plants, nuts, fish, and animals they hunted. During the Ice Age, there were huge animals like mammoths, giant bison, and mastodons that were much bigger than animals today.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">They also ate smaller animals like rabbits and birds, plus many different wild plants. They gathered fruits, roots, nuts, and even seaweed near the ocean. In warm places like South America, they found tropical fruits and nuts in the forests.</span>

            <h2>How They Got Food</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Paleo-Indians got their food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They often followed herds of large animals as they moved across the land. Stone tools were very important for their survival, especially spear points for hunting and scrapers for preparing food and hides.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">To make spear points, they chipped pieces off stones to make them sharp, then tied them to wooden sticks. These spears helped them hunt both large and small animals. They also made knives and scrapers from stone.</span>

            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">When the Ice Age ended and the weather got warmer, many of the huge animals died out. Paleo-Indians had to learn new ways to find food. They started hunting smaller animals and gathering more plants.</span>

            <h2>How They Changed Their Environment</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Paleo-Indians changed their environment in important ways. They were skilled hunters who killed many large animals. Scientists have found places with lots of animal bones, showing they were very good at hunting big animals like mammoths and bison.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">They also used fire to change the land around them. They burned grass and small trees to make open spaces for hunting and living. This burning changed what the landscape looked like and what plants grew there.</span>

            <h2>Their Tools and Connections with Others</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Scientists have found that Paleo-Indians sometimes made tools from stones that came from far away places. This tells us that either they traveled very long distances, or they traded with other groups of people to get these special stones.</span>

            <h2>The Beginning of Native American Tribes</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">About 10,000 years ago, the Ice Age ended and the weather became warmer and more stable. This meant people could stay in one place longer and didn't have to move around as much. They made better tools and their groups got bigger.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">This was the beginning of the many different Native American tribes and nations we know today. Each group developed their own special ways of living, their own languages, and their own traditions based on where they lived.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">The first Americans were amazing people who learned how to survive and thrive in a completely new continent.
