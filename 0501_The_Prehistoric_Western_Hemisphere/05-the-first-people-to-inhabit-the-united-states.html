                Who Were the First Americans?
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                The earliest known inhabitants of the Americas are referred to as Paleo-Indians. The daily life of people living in the americas during the time when the very first people were beginning to populate the region. What they ate, how they got food, where they slept, how they changed the land around them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago, with academics generally agreeing that people reached North America south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet sometime between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago. This period is known as the Lithic stage, characterized by the appearance of lithic flaked stone tools.
            </p>

            <h2>How They Lived</h2>
            
            <p>
                Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers. They typically lived in small, family-based groups called bands, which moved from place to place. This nomadic lifestyle was driven by the search for food. Their populations increased over time, leading to more firmly established territories.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being nomadic, Paleo-Indians often lived in crude shelters, tents, or shallow caves. At the Monte Verde II site in Chile, archaeological findings indicate rectangular dwellings, approximately 20 meters long, that were secured to the ground with wooden stakes.
            </p>

            <h2>What They Ate</h2>

            <p>
                Their diet consisted of wild foods, including plants, nuts, game, and fish. They hunted megafauna, large animals of the Pleistocene era such as mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, musk-oxen, camels, and ancient reindeer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Evidence from sites like Gault (Texas) and Jake Bluff (Oklahoma) indicates they also consumed smaller animals and a wide variety of wild plant foods, including fruit, tubers, nuts, and even seaweed. In South America, Paleo-Indians collected plants and caught small game, including tropical forest fruits and nuts.
            </p>

            <h2>How They Got Food</h2>

            <p>
                They primarily obtained food through hunting and gathering. These early peoples often followed herds of megafauna. Stone tools were crucial for their survival, particularly projectile points and scrapers. Projectile points, such as spear points, were typically made by chipping a single flake from each side of a stone and then attaching it to a wooden or bone shaft.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the climate changed and megafauna became scarcer, late Paleo-Indians adapted by relying on diverse subsistence methods, showing how they developed unique ways of surviving in different environments.
            </p>

            <h2>How They Changed Their Environment</h2>

            <p>
                Early humans impacted their environment primarily through hunting large animals. The sheer number of bones at some kill sites suggests they were skilled big-game hunters. They also used fire to clear land for living and hunting, activities that shaped the landscape.
            </p>

            <p>
                Evidence suggests that early humans burned Beringian landscapes as far back as 34,000 years ago, possibly as a method for hunting megafauna. This shows how the first humans in the Americas adapted to their environment as well as changed it through their interactions with their environment.
            </p>

            <h2>Their Tools and Trade</h2>

            <p>
                The materials used for crafting tools could originate from distant areas, implying long-distance travel or trade networks. For instance, at Meadowcroft Rockshelter, tools were made from materials found far from the site, showing that these early people were either highly mobile or had connections with other groups.
            </p>

            <p>
                The climate stabilized around 10,000 years ago, leading to advances in lithic technology and a more sedentary lifestyle, as well as an increase in population and established territories. This marked the beginning of the development of unique cultures that would eventually become the many different Native American tribes and nations we know today.
            </p>

            <p>
                These first Americans were remarkable people who successfully adapted to a completely new continent, developing the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in diverse environments from the Arctic to the tropics.
