            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Independence from Spain</h2>
            
            <p>
                After almost 300 years of Spanish rule, Peru started to become free in the early 1800s. Other countries in Latin America were also fighting for freedom. Changes in Spain after Napoleon invaded in 1808 also helped Peru's freedom movement.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other parts of Spanish America, local leaders quickly fought against Spain. But Peru mostly stayed loyal to Spain. This was partly because Lima was where Spanish power was strongest in South America. There were many Spanish soldiers there. Also, the criollos (people born in Peru whose parents came from Spain) were happy with their special place in society.
            </p>

            <!-- Independence Movement Section -->
            <h2>The Fight for Independence</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru became free mostly because of two men from other countries: José de San Martín from Argentina and Simón Bolívar from Venezuela. They came to Peru from different directions to free it from Spain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                José de San Martín came to Peru in 1820 after helping Chile become free. On July 28, 1821, he said Peru was free in Lima's main square. San Martín became Peru's first leader with the title "Protector of the Freedom of Peru." But after meeting with Bolívar in Guayaquil in 1822, San Martín left Peru. He thought Bolívar could better finish freeing the country.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though Peru said it was free, Spanish soldiers still controlled big parts of the country. On September 10, 1823, the Peruvian Congress made Simón Bolívar the "Libertador" with power to keep fighting the Spanish. The Spanish were finally beaten at the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824. This battle was led by Antonio José de Sucre, who worked for Bolívar. The Viceroyalty of Peru officially ended on December 30, 1824.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Early Republic Section -->
            <h2>The Foundational Period (1821-1842)</h2>
            
            <p>
                The early years after Peru became free were hard. There was political fighting and the challenge of building a new country after so long under Spanish rule. This time is called the "Foundational Period of the Republic." During this time, Peru set up basic things a country needs:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Made national symbols (flag and song)</li>
                <li>Created Peru's own money</li>
                <li>Set up basic rules for business</li>
                <li>Started the Peruvian Navy and army</li>
                <li>Began schools and national culture</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                But this time was also full of political problems. After San Martín left, Peru had many military leaders, civil wars, and even a short time when Peru and Bolivia were one country (1837-1839). This time of "Military Anarchy" lasted until 1845.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Guano Era Section -->
            <h2>The Guano Era (1845-1866)</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peru's first time of peace and wealth came during what is called the "Guano Era." Guano is bird poop that had built up for hundreds of years on Peru's coastal islands. It was full of nitrogen and was very good as fertilizer in Europe and North America.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Selling guano made Peru very rich. Under President Ramón Castilla, who led Peru twice (1845-1851 and 1855-1862), Peru used this money to:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Build railroads and roads</li>
                <li>Make the military better</li>
                <li>Pay money Peru owed to other countries</li>
                <li>End slavery (1854)</li>
                <li>Stop the tax on native people</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                This time also had the Liberal Revolution of 1854-1855, which made important social changes. But the good times couldn't last because they depended too much on just guano. The guano started to run out, and Peru had money problems by the late 1860s.
            </p>
            
            <!-- War of the Pacific Section -->
            <h2>Crisis and War (1866-1884)</h2>
            
            <p>
                After the Guano Era, Peru had money problems and problems with other countries. The biggest event during this time was the War of the Pacific (1879-1883). Peru and Bolivia fought against Chile over land in the Atacama Desert that had nitrates, which were valuable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peru lost this war and lost valuable land, including Tarapacá, which had lots of nitrates. The war was very bad for Peru. Chilean soldiers took over Lima from 1881 to 1883. The Treaty of Ancón, signed on October 20, 1883, ended the war but left Peru poor and weak.
            </p>
            
            <!-- 20th Century Section -->
            <h2>Peru in the 20th Century</h2>
            
            <p>
                In the 1900s, Peru kept growing as a country, but it had many problems. Some important times were:
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Aristocratic Republic (1895-1919)</h3>
            
            <p>
                This time started when Nicolás de Piérola became President in 1895. A small group of rich people ran the country. They focused on farming for export, mining, and money. During this time, Peru depended more and more on money from Europe and North America.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Oncenio (1919-1930)</h3>
            
            <p>
                This time was the 11-year rule of Augusto B. Leguía, who called his government the "New Motherland." Leguía won the 1919 elections but took power by force soon after. His government did what the U.S. wanted, which made many Peruvians angry. The Great Depression caused Leguía to lose power in 1930.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Military Rule and Democratic Periods</h3>
            
            <p>
                During the 1900s, Peru switched between military rule and elected governments:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Third Militarism (1930-1939): Military rule after the Oncenio</li>
                <li>Democratic Spring (1939-1948): A time of democracy during and after World War II</li>
                <li>The Ochenio (1948-1956): 8 years of military rule by General Manuel A. Odría</li>
                <li>Moderate Civil Reform (1956-1968): A time of elected governments</li>
                <li>Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces (1968-1980): Military rule with big changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Recent History Section -->
            <h2>Recent History (1980-Present)</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 1980, Peru became a democracy again after twelve years of military rule. Fernando Belaúnde Terry, who had been forced out by the military in 1968, was elected president. But the 1980s are called the "lost decade" because the economy was bad and terrorism grew.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Terrorism and the Fujimorato (1980-2000)</h3>
            
            <p>
                During this time, two terrorist groups were active: Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). These groups, especially Sendero Luminoso, killed thousands of people and destroyed many things.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 1990, Alberto Fujimori became president. In 1992, he did a "self-coup," closing Congress and stopping the constitution. His government caught terrorist leaders and fixed the economy, but there was also corruption and human rights abuses. Fujimori ran away from Peru in 2000 because of scandals.
            </p>
            
            <h3>21st Century Peru</h3>
            
            <p>
                Since 2000, Peru has had elected governments but still has problems:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>From 2000 to 2016, the economy grew but many people stayed poor</li>
                <li>A political crisis started in 2016 that still goes on today</li>
                <li>Peru has had problems with democracy, money, and corruption</li>
                <li>Many former presidents have gone to jail or are being investigated</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Even with these problems, Peru has made progress. The country has less poverty, more schools, and more tourism. Peru's rich culture, from old civilizations to colonial times to today, helps shape what Peru is as a country.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The story of how Peru became free and grew into a modern country shows how culture, history, and land have shaped Peru. From the freedom fights led by San Martín and Bolívar to the problems and successes of today, Peru keeps changing while remembering its rich past.
