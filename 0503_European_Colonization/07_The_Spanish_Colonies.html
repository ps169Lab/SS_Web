            <h2>The Spanish Motivation: The Quest for Riches</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Spain was the first European power to build a huge empire in the Americas. Following Columbus's voyages, Spanish explorers called <strong>conquistadors</strong> marched through Mexico, Central America, and South America looking for silver and gold. Their main goal was to find wealth to send back to the King and Queen. However, they also wanted to spread their Catholic faith. Wherever the Spanish went, they built cities, churches, and forts to show that they planned to stay forever and rule the land.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Spain was the first country to build a huge empire in America. Spanish explorers were called <strong>conquistadors</strong>. They looked for gold and silver in Mexico and the South. They wanted to make Spain rich and powerful. They also wanted to teach their religion to everyone they met. They built big cities and strong forts to show they were the bosses of the land.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Imperio_Espa%C3%B1ol_America_1800.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://abbyshearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/havana-cathedral-in-havana-cuba-by-jarrod-from-ramble-around-the-world.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            

            <h2>The Mission System and Life in the Southwest</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the areas that are now Florida, Texas, and California, the Spanish built <strong>missions</strong>. These were not just churches; they were small towns designed to teach Native Americans to be Spanish and follow Spanish ways. Native Americans were expected to live at the missions, learn the Spanish language, and work on mission farms. While some Native Americans joined missions for food and safety, many were forced to live there against their will. This system changed the culture of the American Southwest forever, bringing Spanish buildings, food, and language to the region.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">In the South and the West, the Spanish built <strong>missions</strong>. These were like small villages with a church in the middle. The Spanish wanted Native Americans to live there and learn how to be Spanish. They taught them how to farm and speak a new language. This is why many places in the West today have Spanish names and look like Spanish towns.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/aenetworks/image/upload/c_fill,ar_2,w_3840,h_1920,g_auto/dpr_auto/f_auto/q_auto:eco/v1/gettyimages-543661743-2?_a=BAVAZGB00" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/cropped_image/primary/4DC16DD8-06C5-AEF6-5273C47CA982C7DC.jpg?width=1600&amp;quality=90&amp;mode=crop" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comparing Cultures:</strong> How does the Spanish goal of "settling and converting" differ from the French goal of "trading and moving"?</li>
                <li><strong>The Legacy of St. Augustine:</strong> Why is it important to remember that Spain started cities in the U.S. decades before the English arrived at Jamestown or Plymouth?</li>
                <li><strong>Point of View:</strong> If you were a Native American, what would be the biggest challenge of living at a Spanish mission?</li>
