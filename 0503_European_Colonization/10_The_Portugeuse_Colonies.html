            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Portugal was a small country with a long history of sailing and trading on the ocean. While Spain was exploring the center of the Americas, Portugal claimed the eastern coast of South America, which we now know as Brazil. Their main goal was to get rich through trade. At first, they were looking for a way to reach the spices of Asia, but they soon discovered that Brazil's warm, wet climate was perfect for growing sugarcane. Sugar was very expensive and rare in Europe, and by being the only country selling Brazilian sugar, Portugal could make a lot of money. This control over sugar was called their <strong>monopoly</strong>—or having complete control of a product.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Portugal was a country of famous sailors. They claimed land in South America called Brazil. They did not find gold mines at first. Instead, they found that they could grow sugarcane. People in Europe loved sugar and would pay a lot of money for it. Portugal wanted to be the only country selling sugar so they could make the most money.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/112518-21-History-Caribbean-Slavery-Britain-England.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/about-history.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Portuguese-Colonial-Empire.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            

            <h2>The Rise of the Plantation</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Because sugarcane is very difficult to harvest and process, the Portuguese created huge farms called <strong>plantations</strong>. These farms grew only sugarcane, which they sent to Europe to sell—this is called <strong>export</strong>. The work was very hard and needed many workers. As we learned in our lesson on the Columbian Exchange, many Native Americans died from new diseases. Because they did not have enough workers, the Portuguese began to bring enslaved people from Africa to do the hard work. This tragic system of forcing people to work became a major part of the Brazilian economy for hundreds of years.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Sugar is very hard work to grow. The Portuguese built giant farms called <strong>plantations</strong>. They needed hundreds of workers to cut the cane in the hot sun. When many Native Americans got sick and died from new germs, the Portuguese began to bring enslaved people from Africa to do the work. This was the start of a very sad and difficult time in history.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://portuguesemuseum.org/cmsb/uploads/madeira_sugar_labor_1550x1030.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Value of Sugar:</strong> Today, sugar is in almost everything we eat. Why was it considered "White Gold" in the 1500s? How does that change why a country would sail across the ocean for it?</li>
                <li><strong>Comparing Labor:</strong> How was the Portuguese "Sugar Gold" different from the Spanish "Silver Gold"? Which one required more people to stay and work the land?</li>
                <li><strong>Big Ideas:</strong> Look at the map of South America. Why do you think Portugal only claimed the coast while Spain went deep into the mountains?</li>
