            <h2>The Three Big Reasons</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">During the Age of Exploration, European countries were driven by three
                    powerful motivations known as the <strong>3 G's</strong>: Gold, Glory, and God.
                    <strong>Gold</strong> represented the hunt for riches like spices, gold, and silver.
                    <strong>Glory</strong> was the desire to expand their empires and find fame for their country. Finally, <strong>God</strong> represented the goal of spreading religions like Catholicism or
                    Protestantism to the Americas. Each country balanced these goals differently
                    depending on what they hoped to find.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Explorers had three main reasons for traveling. We call them the <strong>3
                        G's</strong>. <strong>Gold</strong> was the search for money and riches.
                    <strong>Glory</strong> was the search for fame and power for their country.
                    <strong>God</strong> was the desire to spread their religion. Every country wanted these
                    things, but they all had different plans.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://francinemassue.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/9/13091251/europe-reasons-for-exploration-13-728_orig.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Spain: The Conquistadors</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Spain was the first major power to build a massive empire in the
                    Americas. They were driven by the search for silver and gold mines. To control their new
                    <strong>territory</strong>, they built missions where <strong>missionaries</strong> taught
                    Christianity. Their culture left a lasting mark on the language and architecture of the American
                    Southwest and Florida.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Spain was the first country to stay in the Americas. They wanted to find gold
                    and silver. They also built churches called missions to teach their religion. Today, many people in
                    these areas still speak Spanish and live in towns built by Spain.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://mymayansign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Conquest-of-America-Meeting-between-Cortez-and-the-Aztec-emperor.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>France: The Voyageurs</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Unlike Spain, the French were not looking to build huge cities. Instead,
                    they wanted beavers! French traders, known as Voyageurs, traveled deep into the forests of Canada.
                    Because they needed the help of Native Americans to find and trap animals, the French formed strong
                    <strong>alliances</strong> and often lived peacefully alongside Indigenous tribes.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The French did not want to build big cities. They wanted beaver fur to sell
                    in Europe. Because they needed help trapping animals, they became friends and partners with Native
                    Americans.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Fur_traders_in_canada_1777.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>



            <h2>England: The Settlers</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">England’s colonies were different because they were filled with families
                    who wanted to stay forever. Some came for <strong>religious freedom</strong>, while others came to
                    start farms for <strong>cash crops</strong> like tobacco. Because the English wanted to own the land
                    for farming, they often had conflicts with Native American groups who were already living
                    there.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">English colonies were made of families who wanted to live in America forever.
                    Some wanted to practice their own religion. Others wanted to start big farms. Because they wanted so
                    much land for farms, they often fought with Native Americans.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/Turner%201.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>The Netherlands: The Merchants</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Dutch were the ultimate businessmen. They set up "New Netherland"
                    (New York) as a global trading hub. They were very tolerant of different religions because they
                    believed that if you were a good worker, your faith didn't matter. Their <strong>economy</strong>
                    was based almost entirely on the fur trade and shipping goods across the ocean.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Dutch were great at business. They built stores and ports in New York.
                    They let people from many different religions live together. They just wanted to make sure everyone
                    worked hard to trade and sell goods.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/The_fall_of_New_Amsterdam_cph.3g12217.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choosing a Home:</strong> If you were a person living in the 1600s, which of these four
                    colonies would you want to move to? Why? (Think about the work you would do and who your neighbors
                    would be!)</li>
                <li><strong>The Trade-Off:</strong> The French had the best relationship with Native Americans. Why do
                    you think their "Gold" (fur trade) made them better partners than the English "Gold" (farming land)?
