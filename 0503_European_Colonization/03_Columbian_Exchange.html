                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Columbian Exchange:</strong> The movement of plants, animals, and ideas between the Americas and Europe, Africa, and Asia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Native:</strong> Someone or something that comes from a certain place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> The ability of a body to fight off a sickness or disease.</li>

            <h2>What was the Exchange?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">When Christopher Columbus and later explorers arrived in the Americas, they didn't just bring people; they brought an entire biological world. This "exchange" was the movement of living things across the Atlantic Ocean. For the first time in history, the <strong>Old World</strong> (Europe, Africa, and Asia) and the <strong>New World</strong> (the Americas) were connected. This swap changed the diet, health, and environment of every continent on Earth.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Columbian Exchange was a giant trade between the Americas and the rest of the world. Explorers brought plants, animals, and even germs across the ocean. This was the first time these two sides of the world met. It changed what people ate and how they lived all over the world.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>The Great Swap: Who Gave What?</h2>
            <p>Imagine a world without pizza sauce in Italy or chocolate in Switzerland! Before the Columbian Exchange, those things didn't exist in Europe. Use the table below to see what items moved where.</p>

                <h3>The Good: New Foods</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="standard-reading">The introduction of crops like potatoes and corn to Europe and Africa led to a huge population boom. These foods were easy to grow and very nutritious, helping people live longer lives. In the Americas, the arrival of horses changed the lives of many Native American groups, allowing them to travel and hunt much faster.</span>

                <h3>The Bad: Disease and Conflict</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="standard-reading">The darkest part of the Columbian Exchange was the spread of disease. Europeans brought germs like smallpox and the flu by accident. Because Native Americans had no <strong>immunity</strong> to these "Old World" sicknesses, millions of people became ill. This tragic loss of life made it much easier for European countries to take over land and build their colonies.</span>
                    <span class="easy-reading">The exchange also brought bad things. Europeans brought germs and sicknesses like the flu. Native Americans had never been sick with these germs before, so many people died. This made it easier for Europe to take over the land.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Dinner Plate:</strong> Think about your favorite meal. Which parts of it come from the "Old World" and which come from the "New World"? Would that meal even exist without this exchange?</li>
                <li><strong>The Animal Impact:</strong> How do you think the arrival of pigs and cows changed the environment of the Americas compared to when there were only deer and buffalo?</li>
                <li><strong>The Unintended Consequence:</strong> Explorers were looking for "Gold," but they found "Potatoes." Which do you think has had a bigger impact on the world today?</li>
