                <h3>Key Words</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Accepting people who practice different religions or have different beliefs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merchant:</strong> A person whose job is to buy and sell goods for profit.</li>

            <h2>The Dutch Motivation: Business First</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Netherlands was a small country with a big goal: to control world trade. While other countries wanted to build giant empires for their Kings, the Dutch were motivated by making money. They formed the Dutch West India Company to run their business in the Americas. Because they focused on trade, they built their colony, New Netherland, in the perfect spot for shipping: the Hudson River Valley. Their capital, New Amsterdam, became a busy port where <strong>merchants</strong> from all over the world came to do business.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Dutch were the best business people in Europe. They wanted to make money by trading goods. They built a colony called New Netherland in the area that is now New York. They chose this spot because the rivers made it easy for ships to come and go. Their main goal was to make a <strong>profit</strong> by trading furs and other goods.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>Tolerance and Diversity</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Because the Dutch focused on business, they practiced a policy of <strong>tolerance</strong>. They believed that as long as a person was a good worker and helped the colony make money, it didn't matter what religion they practiced or what language they spoke. This made New Netherland one of the most diverse places in North America. People from all over Europe moved there, and many different languages were spoken in the streets of New Amsterdam! Unlike the British, who often fought over religious differences, the Dutch welcomed almost anyone who wanted to work.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Dutch were very fair to people from different places. This is called <strong>tolerance</strong>. They let people practice any religion they wanted. They did not care where you were from, as long as you worked hard. Because of this, New Netherland had people from many different countries living together. Many different languages were spoken in their streets!</span>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Work First" Rule:</strong> Why would a colony focused on making money be more likely to welcome people of different religions?</li>
                <li><strong>Location, Location, Location:</strong> Look at a map of New York. Why was the Hudson River the "secret weapon" for the Dutch merchants?</li>
                <li><strong>Big Ideas:</strong> How does the Dutch idea of <strong>tolerance</strong> still influence the personality of New York City today?</li>
