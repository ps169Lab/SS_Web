                <h2>The Search for Labor</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="standard-reading">As the European "Major Players" built their empires, they became obsessed with "Gold"—not just the metal, but the money made from growing crops like sugar to sell. To run the silver mines in Mexico and the huge farms in Brazil and the Caribbean, they needed thousands of workers. At first, the Spanish and Portuguese forced Native Americans into labor. However, as we saw in the <strong>Columbian Exchange</strong>, germs like smallpox were devastating. With millions of Native Americans dying from disease, European leaders looked to Africa to find a new workforce that they could force into <strong>enslavement</strong>.</span>
                    <span class="easy-reading">European kings wanted to get rich from gold and big farms called <strong>plantations</strong>. They needed many workers. At first, they forced Native Americans to do the work. But many Native Americans died from germs like smallpox. Because so many workers died, Europeans began to force people from Africa to come to the Americas to work instead.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1638892022/EducationHub/photos/sugar-cane-plantation.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Who Was Involved?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Not every European power participated in the slave trade in the same way. <strong>Portugal</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> were the first to start the trade to provide labor for their sugar and gold operations. Later, <strong>England</strong> became the largest trader of enslaved people to power their tobacco and rice farms in the Southern colonies. The <strong>Dutch</strong> were also heavily involved, using their ships to transport people as part of their global business. <strong>France</strong> used enslaved labor primarily on their sugar islands. In contrast, while countries like Sweden or Russia explored the Americas, they were far less involved in the Transatlantic Slave Trade because they did not have large plantation-based colonies in the South.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Different countries played different roles. <strong>Portugal</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> started the trade. <strong>England</strong> became the biggest trader to help their big farms in the South. The <strong>Dutch</strong> used their fast ships to move people. <strong>France</strong> also used enslaved labor. Some other countries that did not have big farms were not as involved in the slave trade.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/03/275503-050-8D640C83/Triangular-Trade-Routes-Shows-movement-of-raw-materials-manufactured-goods-and-enslaved-Africans-between-North-America-Europe-Africa.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://www.aehnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Featured_image_suggestion.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

                <h2>Resistance and Strength</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="standard-reading">It is important to remember that enslaved people were not just numbers in a ledger; they were individuals with families and cultures. They practiced many ways of resisting and fighting back. Some resisted by working slowly or breaking tools, while others escaped to form free communities in the mountains or forests. They kept their African heritage alive through music, stories, and secret religious ceremonies. This strength allowed them to stay connected to who they were in a system that tried to take that away.</span>
                    <span class="easy-reading">Enslaved people were very brave. They did not want to be forced to work, so they found ways to fight back. Some worked slowly or broke tools. Some ran away to live in the woods. They sang songs and told stories from Africa to remember who they were. This helped them stay strong.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/YNBfFgElPsZFEgvyr9IeeYZEUMg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nat-Turner-58e528ce3df78c5162b35906.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://cdn.aaihs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sharples--e1595549350181.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Connection:</strong> Why did the deaths of Native Americans from smallpox lead European powers to look toward Africa for labor?</li>
                <li><strong>Geography and Economy:</strong> Why were the English and Spanish more involved in the slave trade than the French fur traders in Canada? (Think about the type of work being done!)</li>
                <li><strong>Forms of Resistance:</strong> Resistance isn't always a physical fight. How can a song or a story be a way of "fighting back"?</li>
