                <h3>Key Words</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> A permanent place where people build homes and live in a new area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Crop:</strong> A crop like tobacco grown to be sold for money rather than used by the farmer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persecution:</strong> Unfair or mean treatment because of someone's religion or beliefs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The British Motivation: Land and Freedom</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">England's journey to the Americas was different because it wasn't just driven by the King—it was driven by regular people. Some colonists, like those in Virginia, wanted "Gold" and looked for wealth by farming crops like tobacco to sell. Others, like the Pilgrims and Puritans in New England, were running away from unfair treatment because of their religion. They wanted a place where they could practice their faith freely. Because they brought entire families, they built permanent settlements, schools, and local governments, planning to stay in the Americas forever.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">English people moved to America for two big reasons. Some wanted to start farms and make money. Others wanted to practice their own religion without being treated badly. Because they brought their families, they built real towns with schools and churches. They did not plan on moving back to England; they wanted to make a new home in America.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>A Different Relationship with the Land</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The British focus on farming led to a major conflict with Native Americans. To grow crops like wheat or tobacco, the English had to cut down the trees and build fences. To the English, land was something you "owned" once you put a fence around it. To many Native Americans, the land belonged to everyone to share. This difference in thinking led to many wars as the English pushed further into the woods to find more land for their growing population. Unlike the French, who needed the forests for furs, the English replaced the wilderness with towns and farms very quickly.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The English wanted to be farmers. They cut down trees and built fences to show which land was "theirs." Native Americans did not believe people should own the land with fences. This caused many arguments and fights. As more English families arrived, they took more land to build more towns. They changed the forest into farmland very quickly.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Fence Problem:</strong> Why would building a fence cause a conflict between an English settler and a Native American hunter?</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation Match:</strong> If you wanted to start a business, would you move to New France or the British Colonies? If you wanted to move with your family and start a school, where would you go?</li>
                <li><strong>Big Ideas:</strong> How did the arrival of English families change the future of North America differently than the arrival of French fur trappers?</li>
