            <h2>The French Motivation: Beaver Gold</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">While the Spanish were digging for silver in the South, the French found their "gold" in the forests of Canada and the Mississippi River Valley. This gold wasn't a metal—it was the thick, waterproof fur of the beaver. In Europe, beaver hats were very fashionable, and the French realized they could make a lot of money by trading for these pelts. Their main goal was to make money through trade, which meant they didn't need to build massive cities; they needed a network of trading posts and rivers.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The French did not look for gold and silver. Instead, they wanted beaver fur. People in Europe wanted beaver hats very badly. This meant the French could make a lot of money. They built small trading stores along rivers instead of big cities. This allowed them to move quickly and find more furs.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>Living with the Land</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Because the French economy relied on trapping animals, they had a very unique relationship with the environment and the Native American people. French traders, called <strong>voyageurs</strong>, traveled deep into the wilderness, often living in Native American villages and learning their languages. Unlike the English, who cut down forests to build farms, the French kept the forests intact so the animals would stay. They formed strong <strong>allies</strong> with nations like the Huron and the Algonquin, trading metal tools, cloth, and beads for furs.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The French needed to be friends with Native Americans to get furs. French travelers lived in Native American villages and learned their languages. They did not cut down the trees to make farms. They wanted the forest to stay healthy so animals could live there. They became partners in business with many tribes.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Trade-Off:</strong> Why did the French choose to live *with* the Indigenous people rather than pushing them off the land like other European countries?</li>
                <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Look at the map of New France. Why were rivers like the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi so important to their success?</li>
                <li><strong>Big Ideas:</strong> If you were a Native American living in the 1600s, would you rather have the French or the English as your neighbors? Why?</li>
