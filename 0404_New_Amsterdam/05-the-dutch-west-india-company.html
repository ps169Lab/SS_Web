            <h2>A Business, Not a Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Many colonies in the New World were started by Kings, but New York (then called New Netherland) was started by a business called the <strong>Dutch West India Company</strong>. This company was run by wealthy businessmen in the Netherlands. They weren't interested in building a beautiful city; they were interested in making money. They were given a <strong>monopoly</strong> on the fur trade, which meant no other Dutch company was allowed to trade beavers in the area.</span>

            <h2>The Company's Rules</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Because the company owned the colony, they made all the rules. They hired the <strong>governors</strong>, like Peter Stuyvesant, to keep order. They paid for the ships, the food, and the tools that the settlers used. In return, the settlers had to give the company most of the furs they found. The company even decided where people could live. If the company didn't make a profit, the colony would be in big trouble!</span>

            <h2>Investing in the New World</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Dutch West India Company was owned by <strong>shareholders</strong>. These were regular people in Europe who gave the company money to buy ships. If the ships came back full of beaver pelts, the shareholders made a profit. This made New Netherland a very diverse place, because the company didn't care where you came from or what you believed, as long as you were a good worker who could help the company succeed.</span>
