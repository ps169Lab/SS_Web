It flows from the mountains all the way to the ocean. The Yellow River is another important river that gets its name because the water looks yellow from all the soil it carries.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China's different landforms affect how people live. People in the mountains might be farmers who grow crops on the hillsides. People near rivers often fish or use boats to travel. In the desert areas, people might raise animals like camels that can live without much water. The landforms also affect what the weather is like and what kinds of plants and animals can live in each place.</span>
