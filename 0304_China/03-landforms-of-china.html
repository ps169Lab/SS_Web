            <h2>The High Mountains and Plateaus</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China has some of the highest mountains in the world! The Himalayas have Mount Everest, the tallest peak on Earth. Nearby is the Tibetan Plateau, which people call "the roof of the world" because it is so high up. These areas are in Outer China and are very cold.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Many of China's rivers start in these mountains when the snow melts. Because the air is thin and the ground is rocky, people here raise yaks instead of growing crops.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Yellow River is famous for its yellow silt. This river is known for flooding often. While the floods can be dangerous, they leave behind fertile mud that is perfect for growing wheat.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Yangtze is the longest river in China. Unlike the Yellow River, it does not flood as dangerously. It flows through warm, wet basins, making it the perfect place to grow rice.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Gobi and Taklamakan deserts are large, dry places in Outer China. The Taklamakan is so dangerous people call it the "land of no return" because of its shifting sand dunes and lack of water.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In these dry areas, people live near oases. An oasis is a place in the desert where there is water. People use camels to travel across the sand because camels can go a long time without drinking.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Landforms decide where people live. Most people live in the River Lands (Inner China) because of the fresh water and flat land for farming. Very few people live in the Extreme Lands (Outer China) because the mountains and deserts are too difficult to survive in.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Landforms show people where to live. Most people live near rivers. Very few people live in the mountains or deserts.</span>
