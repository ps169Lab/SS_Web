            <p>
                China has some of the highest mountains in the world! The most famous mountain area is called the Himalayas. This is where Mount Everest is located - the tallest mountain on Earth! These mountains are so high that they have snow on top all year long, even when it's hot down below.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another important mountain area is called the Tibetan Plateau. People call it "the roof of the world" because it is so high up. It's like a giant table made of land that sits high above everything else. Many of China's rivers start in these mountains when the snow melts.

                Important Rivers in China
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                China has two very important rivers that are like highways for boats and water for people. The longest river is called the Yangtze River. It flows from the mountains all the way to the ocean. The Yellow River is another important river that gets its name because the water looks yellow from all the soil it carries.
            </p>

            <p>
                These rivers are very important to people in China. They provide water for drinking, growing food, and transportation. Many cities were built next to these rivers because people needed the water to live. The rivers also help farmers grow rice and other crops that feed millions of people.
            </p>

                Deserts and Dry Places
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                China also has large deserts where it is very dry and hot. The biggest desert is called the Gobi Desert. It is so big that it covers parts of both China and Mongolia! In the desert, there is very little water and only special plants can grow there.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Gobi Desert has both sand and rocks. Sometimes strong winds blow the sand around and create big sandstorms. Even though it's hard to live in the desert, some people and animals have learned how to survive there.

                How Landforms Shape Life in China
            </h2>

            <p>
                China's different landforms affect how people live. People in the mountains might be farmers who grow crops on the hillsides. People near rivers often fish or use boats to travel. In the desert areas, people might raise animals like camels that can live without much water. The landforms also affect what the weather is like and what kinds of plants and animals can live in each place.
