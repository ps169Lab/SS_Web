                <span class="standard-reading">Most of China has four seasons just like many places in the United States. Spring brings warm weather and flowers. Summer is hot and often rainy. Fall has cooler weather and beautiful colored leaves. Winter brings cold weather and sometimes snow.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China gets most of its rain during the summer months. This rain comes from special winds called monsoons. These winds blow from the ocean and bring lots of water to help plants grow. The rain is very important for growing rice and other crops that people in China eat.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Some parts of China get much more rain than others. The southeastern parts of China can get very wet during summer, while the northwestern parts stay quite dry all year long. This is why different parts of China grow different kinds of plants and food.</span>

In hot southern areas, people use fans and air conditioning to stay cool. Farmers plant different crops depending on whether their area is hot or cold, wet or dry. The climate also affects what kinds of houses people build and what foods they like to eat.</span>
