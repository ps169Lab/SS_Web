            <p class="subtitle">Understanding China's Weather and Seasons</p>
        
            <h2>A Land of Many Weathers</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China is so large that different parts of the country experience completely different weather at the same time! While the northern regions may be freezing and snowy, the southern regions can be warm and tropical. These differences depend on how far a place is from the equator and how close it is to the mountains or the ocean.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">China is a big country. Different parts have different weather. The north can be snowy while the south is warm.</span>

            <h2>Outer China: Cold and Arid</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the high mountains and deserts of Outer China, the climate is often harsh. The Tibetan Plateau is bitterly cold for most of the year because of its high elevation. The Northwestern deserts are arid, receiving very little precipitation. In these areas, survival depends on finding water at an oasis.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The mountains and deserts are very cold and dry. These places get very little rain. People must find water at an oasis to live.</span>

            <h2>Inner China: Warm and Wet</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The climate changes as you move toward the coast in Inner China. The southern part of the country is warm and receives plenty of rain. This moisture comes from monsoons, which are winds that blow from the Pacific Ocean during the summer. This wet climate is what makes the southern basins perfect for growing rice.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The south is warm and wet. Winds called monsoons bring rain from the ocean. This rain helps rice grow in the south.</span>

            <h2>The Four Seasons</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Much of China experiences four distinct seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. In northern cities like Beijing, winters are very cold and dry, while summers are hot. Because the north gets less rain than the south, farmers there traditionally grew wheat and millet, which do not need as much water as rice.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Many parts of China have four seasons. The north has hot summers and cold winters. Farmers grow wheat here because it needs less water.</span>

            <h2>Rainfall Patterns</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Geography plays a major role in China's rainfall. The southeastern parts of the country are the wettest because they are closest to the ocean. As you move northwest, the land becomes drier because the high mountains block the rain clouds. This is why the landscape changes from green forests to dry, sandy deserts.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The south is the wettest part of China. The west is the driest part. The mountains block the rain clouds from reaching the desert.</span>
