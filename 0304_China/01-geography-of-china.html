            <h2>China’s Place in the World</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China is a massive country located on the continent of Asia. It is so large that it is the third-biggest country on Earth, and it shares borders with 14 different nations, including Russia and India. Its proximity to the Pacific Ocean is a major characteristic of the land, providing a long coastline for trade and fishing.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">China is a very big country in Asia. It touches 14 other countries. It is next to the Pacific Ocean. People use the ocean for fishing and trade.</span>

            <h2>The Population Mystery</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Even though China is huge, the people who live there are not spread out evenly. If you look at a population map, you will notice a "mystery line." Almost 94% of the population lives on the eastern side of the country! To solve this mystery, we have to look at how the physical geography changes from the West to the East.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">China is very big, but almost everyone lives on the east side! We need to look at the land to find out why.</span>

            <h2>Outer China: The Extreme Frontier</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Western China, known as "Outer China," is a region of massive geographic barriers. It features the Himalayan Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau, which sits so high in the atmosphere that it is famously called the "Roof of the World." This region also contains the Taklamakan Desert, a place of shifting sand dunes and extreme temperatures where very little can survive.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Outer China is in the West. It has very high mountains and big deserts. It is very cold and dry here. It is hard for plants to grow.</span>
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://quizizz.com/_media/quizzes/47d04c66-5fbb-4d22-9df4-94c143b1395e" alt="Physical Features of China" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In ancient times, the rocky terrain and thin air of the mountains made farming impossible. The deserts were equally difficult, as the lack of water made it hard to sustain a village. Because of these harsh conditions, Outer China remained a sparsely populated frontier for thousands of years.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">It was hard to farm here long ago because of the rocks and dry sand. Not many people live in this part of China.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Inner China: The Heartland</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In contrast, Eastern China—or "Inner China"—is a welcoming heartland. This region is much closer to sea level and is made up of low river plains, fertile basins, and coastal hills. The climate here is much more temperate, with predictable seasons and plenty of rainfall coming off the Pacific Ocean.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Inner China is in the East. It has flat land and many rivers. The weather is warmer and it rains more.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The great rivers of this region, the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Chang Jiang (Yangtze), provided the two things every civilization needs: fresh water and transportation. When these rivers flooded, they deposited nutrient-rich silt into the soil, allowing farmers to grow massive amounts of wheat and rice. This abundance of food allowed the population to grow larger and larger over time.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The rivers gave people water and good soil. Farmers could grow lots of food here like rice and wheat. This is why so many people live in the East.</span>

            <h2>Geography Shapes the Story</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Today, the geography of China still dictates where the biggest cities are built. While Outer China is known for its beautiful, rugged scenery, Inner China is home to millions of people in bustling cities like Shanghai and Beijing. The physical landforms of China acting as either "barriers" or "magnets" is the key to solving the population mystery.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The land shows people where to build their homes. Most people live in the East near the rivers and the ocean. Inner China is the home of the biggest cities.</span>
