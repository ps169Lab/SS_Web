People began to think that maybe they didn't need emperors anymore. In 1912, China became a republic, which means the people could choose their leaders instead of having kings and queens rule them.</span>

This shows how China has found a way to be both very old and very new at the same time, keeping the best parts of their past while building an exciting future.</span>
