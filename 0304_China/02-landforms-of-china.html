            <h2>Outer China: The High West and North</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">As we saw on our population map, very few people live in the West and North. This area is known as Outer China. In the Southwest, you will find the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. Because the plateau is so high and flat, it is called the "Roof of the World." It acts as a massive barrier that makes it difficult for people to build large cities.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Outer China is in the West and North. The Southwest has very high mountains. The Tibetan Plateau is called the "Roof of the World." It is very hard to build cities here.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Many of China's rivers start in these high Western mountains when the snow melts. However, the ground is too rocky for farming. Instead of planting crops, the people who live in the West raise yaks for milk and wool.</span>

            <h2>Inner China: The River Heartland of the East</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Inner China is located in the East. This is the "Heartland" where most of China's population lives. The land here is much lower and flatter than the West, making it the perfect place for people to build farms and cities.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Inner China is in the East. Most people live here. The land is flat and good for farms.</span>
            </p>

            <h3>The Yellow River (Huang He) of the North</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the North of Inner China, the Huang He (Yellow River) flows through the North China Plain. This river is famous for carrying yellow silt. Even though this river is known for dangerous flooding, the floods are a "magnet" for farmers because they leave behind rich, fertile mud for growing wheat.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Yellow River is in the North. It carries yellow silt. This river floods a lot. The mud from the floods helps farmers grow wheat.</span>
            </p>

            <h3>The Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) of the South</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the South of Inner China, you will find the Yangtze River. It is the longest river in the country! Unlike the Yellow River in the North, the Yangtze does not flood as dangerously. It flows through warm, wet basins that are perfect for growing rice to feed millions of people.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Yangtze is the longest river. It is in the South. It does not flood as much. It is warm and wet, so people grow rice here.</span>

            <h2>The Dry Deserts of the Northwest</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Northwest of Outer China is home to the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts. These are some of the driest places on Earth. The Taklamakan is known as the "land of no return" because of its giant sand dunes. These deserts act as a barrier, keeping the population in the East.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Northwest has big deserts. They are very dry. One is called the "land of no return." Not many people live here.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Life in the dry Northwest is only possible near an oasis, where there is a small supply of water. People use camels to travel across these sandy regions because they are built to survive in the heat.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">People live near water called an oasis. They use camels to travel in the Northwest.</span>

            <h2>Solving the Mystery: Barriers vs. Magnets</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The landforms of China explain why the population is spread out the way it is. The high mountains of the Southwest and the dry deserts of the Northwest are "Barriers" that make life difficult. The river plains of the East are "Magnets" that provide water and food. That is why the "Heartland" of Inner China is so crowded today!</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Landforms show us why people live in the East. Mountains and deserts are hard to live in. Rivers and flat land are easy to live in. Most people live in the East!</span>
