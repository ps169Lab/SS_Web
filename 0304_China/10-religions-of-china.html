They might light incense, which makes sweet-smelling smoke, or leave flowers and food as gifts. Buddhist monks are special people who spend their whole lives learning about Buddhism and helping others. They wear orange or gray robes and often have shaved heads.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Confucianism comes from the teachings of a wise man named Confucius who lived in China long ago. He taught people how to be good to their families and friends. Confucius said that children should respect their parents, students should listen to their teachers, and everyone should be honest and kind.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">Confucianism is not exactly like other religions because it focuses more on how to behave well than on praying to gods. It teaches that if everyone is respectful and works hard, society will be peaceful and happy. Many Chinese families still follow Confucius's teachings about being good to each other.</span>

                How Religions Mix Together
            </h2>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">What makes China special is that many people follow ideas from different religions at the same time. A Chinese person might visit a Buddhist temple, follow Confucian ideas about respecting their parents, and also practice Taoist exercises. They don't see this as confusing - instead, they take the best ideas from each way of thinking to help them live good lives. This mixing of different beliefs has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of years.</span>
