                <span class="standard-reading">Long ago, Chinese emperors built the Great Wall to protect their country from enemies who might attack from the north. The wall was like a giant fence that made it hard for enemy armies to get into China. Soldiers would stand on top of the wall and watch for danger.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Building the Great Wall was very hard work that took many, many years.

                <span class="standard-reading">The workers had to carry heavy stones up steep mountains and work in very hot and cold weather. Building the wall was dangerous work, and many people died while working on it. This makes the Great Wall not just amazing, but also very sad to think about.</span>
