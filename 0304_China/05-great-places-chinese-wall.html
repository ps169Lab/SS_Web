                <span class="standard-reading">Long ago, Chinese emperors built the Great Wall to protect their country from enemies who might attack from the north.

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The wall also had special towers where soldiers could live and store weapons. If enemies were coming, soldiers could light fires or use drums to send messages quickly along the wall to warn other soldiers far away.</span>
