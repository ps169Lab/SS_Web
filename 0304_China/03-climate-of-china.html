            <h2>A Land of Many Weathers</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">China is so large that different parts of the country experience completely different weather at the same time! These differences help explain our population mystery. While the Northern regions may be freezing and snowy, the Southern regions can be warm and tropical. These patterns depend on how far a place is from the equator and its proximity to the Pacific Ocean in the East.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">China is a big country. Different parts have different weather. The North can be snowy while the South is warm. This helps us see why people live in the East.</span>

            <h2>Outer China: The Cold and Arid West</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the West and Northwest (Outer China), the climate is a "barrier" to large populations. The Tibetan Plateau in the Southwest is bitterly cold for most of the year because it is so high up. The Northwest deserts are arid, receiving almost no precipitation. Without enough rain to grow crops, it was very difficult for large groups of people to live in the West.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The West and Northwest are very cold and dry. This is Outer China. It is hard to live here because there is not enough rain to grow food.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Inner China: Warm and Wet in the East</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">As you move East into Inner China, the climate becomes a "magnet" for people. The Southern part of the country is warm and receives plenty of rain from the Pacific Ocean. During the summer, seasonal winds called monsoons blow in from the East and South, bringing heavy rain. This wet, warm climate is perfect for the rice paddies found in the Southern basins.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The South and East are warm and wet. This is Inner China. Winds called monsoons bring rain from the ocean. This rain helps rice grow in the South.</span>

            <h2>The Four Seasons of the North</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the Northern part of Inner China, there are four distinct seasons. While the North is drier than the South, it still gets enough rain for farming. However, because it is colder than the South, farmers in the North traditionally grow wheat instead of rice. Wheat is a hardier crop that can handle the chilly Northern winters.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The North has four seasons. It is colder than the South. Farmers grow wheat here because wheat can grow in colder weather.</span>

            <h2>Why the West is Dry: The Rain Shadow</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Geography also creates "rain shadows." In the East and South, the land is wet because it is near the ocean. However, as clouds move West toward Outer China, the high Himalayan mountains block the rain. This is why the East is covered in green forests and farms, while the West and Northwest are covered in dry, sandy deserts.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The South and East get lots of rain from the ocean. In the West, the high mountains block the rain clouds. This is why the West is so dry and has big deserts.</span>
