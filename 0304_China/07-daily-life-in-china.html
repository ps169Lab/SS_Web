            <p>Each year, more than 10 million Chinese students take the gaokao—the very hard test that determines university admission. With only 500,000 spots at the nation’s top 100 universities, a single point on the test can make or break a student’s future. The Highest Exam shows how this one high-stakes test shapes society and influences education around the world.</p><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/WLUarKbmUXuuhDC7PG5_Qw/articles/3f5603d6adeaf0e8347f90a895ff1614.jpg/public" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p><p><img src="https://www.alittledynasty.com/uploads/9/6/8/6/9686382/2766603_orig.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

People often ride bicycles, take buses, or use fast trains to get around. Life in China today mixes old traditions with new, modern ways of living.</span>
