                Who Was Harriet Tubman?
            </h2>
            
            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                Harriet Tubman was born around 1822 in Maryland as an enslaved person named Araminta Ross. As a child, she suffered a serious head injury that caused her to have visions throughout her life. She believed these visions were messages from God telling her to help others.

            <p>
                In 1849, Harriet escaped from slavery and made her way to freedom in the North. But instead of staying safe, she decided to go back and help others escape too. This dangerous work would make her one of the most famous heroes in American history.

            <h2>
                Harriet Becomes "Moses"
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Harriet Tubman became the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad. She made about 13 dangerous trips back to Maryland to lead enslaved people to freedom. She personally rescued around 70 people and gave instructions to 50 or 60 more who then escaped on their own. She travelled at night so no one would get caught and used her knowledge of the land to guide people to freedom.
            </p><p><img src="https://phillyjazz.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/international-underground-railroad-month.jpg?w=672&amp;h=372&amp;crop=1" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                People called her "Moses" because, like the biblical Moses who led his people out of slavery in Egypt, Harriet led her people out of slavery in the South. She was proud to say, "I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." When the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1850, it became even more dangerous to help escaping slaves. This law said that even in free states, people had to return escaped slaves to their owners. Because of this law, Harriet started leading people all the way to Canada, where they would be truly safe.

            <h2>
                How Harriet Helped People Escape
            </h2>

            <p>
                Harriet was very smart about how she helped people escape. She always traveled at night and used the North Star to guide her way. She knew which houses were safe and which people could be trusted. She carried a gun to protect herself and the people she was helping, but she never had to use it to hurt anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Harriet also used clever tricks to avoid getting caught. Sometimes she would disguise herself as an old woman or pretend to be a field worker. She knew that slave catchers were looking for groups of people traveling north, so she would sometimes travel south first to throw them off the trail.
            </p>

                More Than Just the Underground Railroad
            </h2>

            <p>
                During the Civil War, Harriet served as a nurse, scout, and spy for the Union Army. She even helped plan a raid that freed over 750 enslaved people in one day. After the war, she continued fighting for equal rights and became a strong supporter of women's right to vote.
            </p>

            <p>
                Later in life, Harriet opened a home for elderly African Americans in New York. She wanted to make sure that people who had been enslaved would have a safe place to live when they got old. She continued to help others until she died in 1913.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Harriet's Legacy
            </h2>

            <p>
                Harriet Tubman showed incredible courage in her fight for freedom. She once said, "There was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other." Her bravery helped many people find freedom and showed that one person can make a huge difference in the fight for what is right.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Harriet Tubman is remembered as one of America's greatest heroes. Her face will soon appear on the twenty-dollar bill, and there are museums and monuments dedicated to her memory. She proved that even someone born into slavery could become a powerful force for freedom and justice.
