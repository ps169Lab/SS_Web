                Who Was Harriet Tubman?

            <!-- Main content paragraphs -->
            <p>
                Harriet Tubman was born around 1822 in Maryland as an enslaved person named Araminta Ross. As a child, she suffered a serious head injury that caused her to have visions throughout her life. She believed these visions were messages from God telling her to help others.

            <p>
                In 1849, Harriet escaped from slavery and made her way to freedom in the North. But instead of staying safe, she decided to go back and help others escape too. This dangerous work would make her one of the most famous heroes in American history.

                The Underground Railroad
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Underground Railroad was not actually a railroad with trains and tracks. It was a secret network of people who helped enslaved people escape to freedom. These brave helpers were called "conductors," and the safe houses where people could hide were called "stations."
            </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/aenetworks/image/upload/c_fill,ar_2,w_3840,h_1920,g_auto/dpr_auto/f_auto/q_auto:eco/v1/underground-railroad-gettyimages-645161544?_a=BAVAZGDX0" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                The Underground Railroad was very dangerous work. If conductors were caught helping enslaved people escape, they could be arrested and put in jail. The escaping people faced even worse punishments if they were captured.

            <h3>
                Harriet Becomes "Moses"
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Harriet Tubman became the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad. She made about 13 dangerous trips back to Maryland to lead enslaved people to freedom. She personally rescued around 70 people and gave instructions to 50 or 60 more who then escaped on their own. She travelled at night so no one would get caught and used her knowledge of the land to guide people to freedom. </p><p><img src="https://phillyjazz.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/international-underground-railroad-month.jpg?w=672&amp;h=372&amp;crop=1" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>
                People called her "Moses" because, like the biblical Moses who led his people out of slavery in Egypt, Harriet led her people out of slavery in the South. She was proud to say, "I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." When the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1850, it became even more dangerous to help escaping slaves. This law said that even in free states, people had to return escaped slaves to their owners. Because of this law, Harriet started leading people all the way to Canada, where they would be truly safe.</p>

            <h2>Freedom Quilts - The Underground Railroads Secret Code</h2><div>During the time of Slavery, it was illegal to teach an enslaved person how to read or write. But that didn't mean that enslaved people weren't smart. They used their intelligence to create a secret code to help each other on the Underground Railroad. They would so patterns into quilts called "Freedom Quilts". If someone who wasn't in on the code saw the quilt, they would just think it was a regular blanket. But people traveling the underground railroad knew how to read the codes, and they used them to help them escape. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div><img src="https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/media/k2/items/cache/e957ef539752eb4135feefc10395f43e_XL.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></div>

            <h2>
                More Than Just the Underground Railroad
            </h2>

            <p>
                During the Civil War, Harriet served as a nurse, scout, and spy for the Union Army. She even helped plan a raid that freed over 750 enslaved people in one day. After the war, she continued fighting for equal rights and became a strong supporter of women's right to vote.
            </p>

            <p>
                Harriet Tubman showed incredible courage in her fight for freedom. She once said, "There was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other." Her bravery helped many people find freedom and showed that one person can make a huge difference in the fight for what is right.
