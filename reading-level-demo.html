                    Long before New York became the state we know today, slavery was part of daily life. The Dutch brought the first enslaved Africans to New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1626. When the English took control in the 1660s, they continued bringing enslaved people to work in the colony.

                    A long time ago, New York was very different. People from Holland brought African people to work as slaves in 1626. Later, people from England took over and kept bringing more slaves to work.

                    By 1703, almost half of all families in New York City owned enslaved people. This made New York City the second-largest slave-owning city in all the American colonies, after Charleston, South Carolina.

                    Enslaved people in New York worked many different jobs. They worked as farmers growing crops, builders constructing houses, and servants in homes. Some worked in skilled trades like carpentry or blacksmithing. Others worked loading and unloading ships at the busy New York harbor.

                    Under Dutch rule, enslaved families were usually kept together, and they could join churches and get married. But when the English took control, life became much harder. New laws said enslaved people could not travel, trade, or buy things without permission from their owners.

                    In 1712, a group of enslaved New Yorkers fought back against their treatment. This was called the New York Slave Revolt of 1712. A group of about 20 slaves set a building on fire and while the slave owners were distracted trying to put it out, they tried to run away. Sadly, they were all caught and brought back to the slave owners. While this rebellion was not successful, it showed that enslaved people would never stop wanting their freedom.
