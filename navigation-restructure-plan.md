# SS_Web Navigation Restructure Plan

## Overview
Reorganize the main index.html file to provide grade-level navigation (Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5) and create separate pages for each grade containing links to their respective units.

## Current Structure Analysis
The current index.html displays all units from different grades in a single grid layout, making it difficult for teachers and students to find grade-appropriate content.

## Proposed New Structure

### Main Index Page (index.html)
- Clean landing page with three prominent grade-level cards
- Each card links to a dedicated grade page
- Maintains existing styling and Google Translate widget
- Includes teacher information section

### Grade-Level Pages
1. **grade3.html** - Grade 3 Units
2. **grade4.html** - Grade 4 Units  
3. **grade5.html** - Grade 5 Units

## Unit Organization by Grade

### Grade 3 Units (4 units)
- **0301_Intro_to_Geography** - Introduction to Geography
- **0303_Nigeria** - Exploring Nigeria
- **0304_China** - Exploring China
