                The Start of the War
            </h2>
            
            <p>The American Revolution was a war between British Colonists and their own Government. The colonists wanted to be their own country. Some important things happened that helped the Americans win against the powerful British army. These were the militias who fought the war, help from France, and a big, decisive victory at the Battle of Yorktown.</p><p><img src="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/american-revolution-colonial-militia-soldier-randy-steele.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>The war started in April 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. British troops marched to seize weapons that the colonists had stored. But the colonists were ready for them! The first shots were fired, and the war had begun. The British soldiers were strong and had lots of supplies, but the American colonists were tough and didn't give up!</p>

                The Role of Militias in the Revolution
            </h2>
            
            <p>The colonists were fighting against their own government. The only army they had ever had was now their enemy, so they had to make their own armies. They formed small groups, called <b>militias. </b>Militias weren't trained like the British soldiers. They were regular people - farmers and shopkeepers. They didn't have very good weapons. To make things worse, the British Army also had a powerful navy (ships that are used to fight war at sea). </p><p>But one thing that the <b>militias</b> had was that they knew the land really well. They would hide and surprise the British soldiers, which made it hard for the British to fight back in their usual way.</p><p><img src="https://allthingsliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KingsMountain-Battle.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

                Key Battles of the Revolution
            </h2>
            
            <p>One of the first big battles was the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775. The British won, but they lost a lot of soldiers. This surprised them - they thought it would be easy to fight against a group of people who had no training and worse weapons. This showed the British that the Americans were serious and wouldn't be easy to defeat.</p><p>A lot of other battles happened and the British won a lot of them - but slowly the revolutionary army started to gain more victories. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/72/127472-050-1DEA56EB/grenadiers-British-painting-Battle-of-Bunker-Hill-1909.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>A big turning point in the war was the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. Saratoga is a place in New York State. The British wanted to take over New York because out of all of the 13 Colonies, New York was in the middle. Whoever controlled New York would have the advantage of being able to stop the flow of supplies and soldiers of their enemy army. The Americans won this battle, and their victory in this one battle changed the whole war. Because when they won, France saw that they might have a chance - so France decided to help them. They started sending soldiers, weapons, and ships. With France's help, the Patrior army became much more powerful. The French navy was especially important because it helped to block the British ships from bringing supplies and soldiers to America.</p><p><img src="https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/French-Strategy1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            </h2>
            
            <p>The most important battle of the war was the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. The American and French armies worked together to trap the British soldiers, led by General Cornwallis, in Yorktown, Virginia. The French navy kept the British ships away so they couldn't escape. The British soldiers were surrounded. After this battle, the British decided that fighting the war was more trouble than it was worth. They decided to surrender. The Patriots won the war and now America was it's own country!</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/US_Army_52414_Assault_on_Redoubt_10_at_Yorktown.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>This was a huge win for the Americans! The British leaders knew they couldn't win the war, so they started talking about peace. In 1783, they signed a paper called the <b>Treaty of Paris</b>, which said that America was finally free and independent! The American Revolution showed that even regular people can win against a powerful army if they are brave, determined, and work together!</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Surrender_of_Lord_Cornwallis.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
