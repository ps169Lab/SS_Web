The American Revolution was a super important fight for freedom! It all started with some brave colonists who wanted to be their own country. Some important things happened that helped the Americans win against the powerful British army. These were the amazing militias, help from France, and a big, decisive victory at the Battle of Yorktown.

The war started in April 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. British troops marched to seize weapons that the colonists had stored. But the colonists were ready for them! The first shots were fired, and the war had begun. The British soldiers were strong and had lots of supplies, but the American colonists were tough and didn't give up!

The colonists had militias, which were like groups of regular people who became soldiers when they were needed. They weren't trained like the British soldiers, but they knew the land really well. They were farmers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen who fought to protect their homes and families. They would hide and surprise the British soldiers, which made it hard for the British to fight back in their usual way.

One of the first big battles was the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775. The British won, but they lost a lot of soldiers. This showed the British that the Americans were serious and wouldn't be easy to defeat.

A big turning point in the war was the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. The Americans won, and this made France, a powerful country, want to help them! France gave the Americans money, soldiers, and ships. The French navy was especially important because it helped to block the British ships from bringing supplies and soldiers to America.

The most important battle of the war was the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. The American and French armies worked together to trap the British soldiers, led by General Cornwallis, in Yorktown, Virginia. The French navy kept the British ships away so they couldn't escape. The British soldiers were surrounded and had to surrender!

This was a huge win for the Americans! The British leaders knew they couldn't win the war, so they started talking about peace. In 1783, they signed a paper called the Treaty of Paris, which said that America was finally free and independent! The American Revolution showed that even regular people can win against a powerful army if they are brave, determined, and work together!
