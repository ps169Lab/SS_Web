            <h2>
                What Was the Civil War?
            </h2>
            
            <p>The Civil War was a very sad and important time in American history. It was a big fight between the North and the South that lasted from 1861 to 1865. It was the deadliest war in American history, and it changed the country forever.</p>
            
            <p>There were many reasons why the Civil War started, but one of the biggest was slavery. The South depended on slaves to work on their farms, especially to grow cotton. But many people in the North thought slavery was wrong and wanted to end it. This made the North and South very angry with each other.</p>

            <h2>
                Causes of the Civil War
            </h2>
            
            <p>Another reason was about states' rights. The South thought that each state should be able to make its own rules, even if it meant allowing slavery. The North thought that the federal government should have more power to make laws for the whole country. This disagreement about who should have more power also led to the war.</p>
            
            <p>The North and South also had different economies. The South was mostly farms, while the North had more factories and businesses. They had different ideas about what was important for the country.</p>

                The Argument Over Federal vs. State Governments
            </h2>
            
            <p>Abraham Lincoln became president in 1860. He didn't want slavery to spread to new states. This made the South very worried, and some states decided to leave the United States and form their own country called the Confederate States of America.</p>
            
            <p>The war started when the South attacked a fort called Fort Sumter. Lincoln asked for soldiers to fight the South and bring the country back together. Many battles were fought, and many people died. Some important battles were the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Vicksburg.</p>

            </h2>
            
            <p>Finally, in 1865, the South surrendered. The Civil War ended slavery, made the United States stronger, and showed that states couldn't just leave the country whenever they wanted. But it also left the South in ruins and created many problems that the country had to deal with for many years to come. It was a difficult time, but it helped make America what it is today.</p>

            <h2>
                The Confederacy
            </h2>
            
            <p>The Confederate States of America, or the Confederacy, was formed by the southern states that seceded from the Union. It had its own constitution, president (Jefferson Davis), and capital (Richmond, Virginia). The Confederacy claimed to be an independent nation, but it was never recognized by any foreign country.</p>
            
            <p>The Confederacy faced many challenges during the war. It had a smaller population than the North, fewer factories and railroads, and less money and resources. Despite these disadvantages, the Confederate Army, led by skilled generals like Robert E. Lee and Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, won several important battles, especially in the eastern theater of the war.</p>
            
            <p>However, the Confederacy's resources were gradually depleted as the war continued. Union naval blockades prevented the South from exporting cotton and importing needed supplies. Union armies captured key cities and transportation routes. By 1865, the Confederate Army was severely weakened, and the Confederacy collapsed after Lee's surrender.</p>

                The End of the War and Its Legacy
            </h2>
            
            <p>The Civil War ended in April 1865 with the surrender of Confederate forces. General Robert E. Lee surrendered the main Confederate army to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. Other Confederate armies surrendered in the following weeks. Just days after Lee's surrender, on April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.</p>
            
            <p>The Civil War had profound and lasting effects on the United States. It preserved the Union and ended slavery, which was officially abolished by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in December 1865. The war also strengthened the federal government and established that states could not secede from the Union.</p>
            
            <p>However, the war left the South devastated, with destroyed cities, farms, and infrastructure. The period after the war, known as Reconstruction, was a difficult time as the country tried to rebuild and reintegrate the southern states. The legacy of the Civil War and the unresolved issues of racial equality would continue to shape American society for generations to come.</p>
