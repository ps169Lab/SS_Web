            </h2>
            
            <p>The United States changed a lot between the American Revolution and the Civil War! It got bigger, had new inventions, and more people moved around. Our country grew from a small group of states into a big one that stretched across the continent. People were also trying to figure out what it meant to be free and how to run their own country.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest things that happened was that the U.S. gained a lot of land. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 was like buying a giant piece of land from France â€“ it doubled the size of the country! Then, we added Texas, the Oregon Territory, and land from Mexico. The U.S. stretched all the way to the Pacific Ocean! But, this also caused problems for Native Americans who lost their homes and land.</p><p><img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1638882732/EducationHub/photos/territorial-gains-by-the-us.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            <p>New inventions also changed the country. Railroads, canals, and steamboats made it easier to travel and trade. The telegraph let people send messages super fast! These inventions helped the country grow, especially in the North where factories were built. But, the South was still mostly farms, and they used slaves to do a lot of the work.</p><p><img src="https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/9dd25524-761a-000d-d79f-86a5086d4774/cfd76ab3-516d-4dba-9b6b-b56d910db391/6_PromontorySummit.jpg?w=1500&h=904&auto=format&q=75&fit=crop" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

            </h2>
        
            <p>People also started moving around a lot. Some went west to find new land and opportunities. Others came from Europe to live in America. This made the country more interesting, but it also caused some problems. One big problem was slavery. People in the North and South couldn't agree about it, and it caused a lot of tension.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/37/151537-159-3A307F3E/Rocky-Mountains-Emigrants-Crossing-the-Plains-lithograph.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

                The Road to Civil War
            </h2>
        
            <p>All these changes made people think about what it meant to be free and have rights. Some people wanted to end slavery and give women more rights. But, it was hard to agree on everything. The North and South had different ideas about how the country should be run, and it eventually led to the Civil War. This war was a big test for the country, and it helped set the stage for a new beginning.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/72/220272-138-7355553C/pop-culture-Abraham-Lincoln.jpg?w=800&h=450&c=crop" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
