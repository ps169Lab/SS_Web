            <h2>
                What Was the Civil War?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The American Civil War was a conflict fought between the United States (the Union or the North) and the Confederate States of America (the Confederacy or the South) from 1861 to 1865. It was the deadliest war in American history, with about 620,000 soldiers dying from combat, disease, and other causes. The war began after several southern states seceded (withdrew) from the United States following the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Civil War was fought for many reasons, but the main issues were slavery and states' rights. The southern states wanted to protect the institution of slavery, which was important to their economy, while many northerners wanted to limit or end slavery. There were also disagreements about whether the federal government or individual states should have more power.
            </p>

                Causes of the Civil War
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Civil War had several important causes that developed over many years. One of the main causes was the issue of slavery. The southern states relied heavily on slave labor for their agricultural economy, especially for growing cotton. Many people in the northern states opposed slavery for moral reasons, and there was growing pressure to limit or abolish it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another major cause was the debate over states' rights versus federal power. The southern states believed that individual states should have more power to make their own decisions, including whether to allow slavery. They argued that the federal government was becoming too powerful and was interfering with their rights. The northern states generally supported a stronger federal government.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Economic differences between the North and South also contributed to tensions. The South had an agricultural economy based on large plantations and slave labor, while the North had a more diverse economy with growing industry and manufacturing. These different economic systems led to different interests and priorities.

                The Argument Over Federal vs. State Governments
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                One of the central debates leading up to the Civil War was about the proper balance of power between the federal government and state governments. This debate had been part of American politics since the founding of the country.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The southern states argued for "states' rights," the idea that states should have significant power to govern themselves and that the federal government's power should be limited. They believed that states had the right to nullify (reject) federal laws they disagreed with and even to secede from the Union if they felt their rights were being violated.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The northern states, especially after Lincoln's election, generally supported a stronger federal government that could make and enforce laws for the entire country. They believed that the Union was permanent and that states did not have the right to secede. This disagreement about the nature of the Union and the powers of the federal government was a fundamental cause of the Civil War.

                Abraham Lincoln and the Start of the War
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States in November 1860. Although Lincoln personally opposed slavery, he had not campaigned on abolishing it where it already existed. However, many southerners feared that his election would lead to the end of slavery and their way of life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response to Lincoln's election, seven southern states seceded from the Union before he even took office: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. These states formed the Confederate States of America in February 1861, with Jefferson Davis as their president.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lincoln was inaugurated as president on March 4, 1861. In his inaugural address, he argued that secession was illegal and that he would not accept the breakup of the Union. The war began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, a Union fort in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. After this attack, Lincoln called for volunteers to put down the rebellion, and four more states seceded to join the Confederacy: Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

            <p>
                The Civil War included many important battles across the eastern and western parts of the country. Some of the most significant battles included:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>First Battle of Bull Run (July 1861): The first major battle of the war, which ended in a Confederate victory and showed that the war would not be quickly resolved.</li>
                <li>Battle of Shiloh (April 1862): A major battle in Tennessee that resulted in heavy casualties on both sides but ultimately a Union victory.</li>
                <li>Battle of Antietam (September 1862): The bloodiest single day in American history, which ended the Confederate invasion of Maryland and gave Lincoln the opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.</li>
                <li>Battle of Gettysburg (July 1863): A crucial Union victory that stopped the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania and marked a turning point in the war.</li>
                <li>Siege of Vicksburg (May-July 1863): A Union victory that gave the North control of the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy.</li>
                <li>Battle of Atlanta (July 1864): A Union victory that helped secure Lincoln's re-election and led to Sherman's March to the Sea.</li>
                <li>Surrender at Appomattox Court House (April 1865): Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant, effectively ending the war.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- The Confederacy Section -->
            <h2>
                The Confederacy
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Confederate States of America, or the Confederacy, was formed by the southern states that seceded from the Union. It had its own constitution, president (Jefferson Davis), and capital (Richmond, Virginia). The Confederacy claimed to be an independent nation, but it was never recognized by any foreign country.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Confederacy faced many challenges during the war. It had a smaller population than the North, fewer factories and railroads, and less money and resources. Despite these disadvantages, the Confederate Army, led by skilled generals like Robert E. Lee and Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, won several important battles, especially in the eastern theater of the war.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Confederacy's resources were gradually depleted as the war continued. Union naval blockades prevented the South from exporting cotton and importing needed supplies. Union armies captured key cities and transportation routes. By 1865, the Confederate Army was severely weakened, and the Confederacy collapsed after Lee's surrender.

                The End of the War and Its Legacy
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Civil War ended in April 1865 with the surrender of Confederate forces. General Robert E. Lee surrendered the main Confederate army to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. Other Confederate armies surrendered in the following weeks. Just days after Lee's surrender, on April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Civil War had profound and lasting effects on the United States. It preserved the Union and ended slavery, which was officially abolished by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in December 1865. The war also strengthened the federal government and established that states could not secede from the Union.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the war left the South devastated, with destroyed cities, farms, and infrastructure. The period after the war, known as Reconstruction, was a difficult time as the country tried to rebuild and reintegrate the southern states. The legacy of the Civil War and the unresolved issues of racial equality would continue to shape American society for generations to come.
