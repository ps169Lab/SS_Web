            <h2>
                What Was Manifest Destiny?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Manifest Destiny was a belief that became popular in the United States during the 1840s. It was the idea that the United States was destined by God to expand its territory across the entire North American continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The term "Manifest Destiny" was first used in 1845 by a newspaper editor named John O'Sullivan, who wrote that it was "our manifest destiny to overspread the continent."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This belief suggested that American expansion was not only good but inevitable and divinely approved. Many Americans believed that they had a special mission to spread their form of democracy, freedom, and civilization across the continent. Manifest Destiny became a powerful idea that helped justify the country's territorial growth.

            <h2>
                The Louisiana Purchase
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The westward expansion of the United States began even before the idea of Manifest Destiny became popular. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson made one of the most important land deals in American history: the Louisiana Purchase. The United States bought about 828,000 square miles of land from France for $15 million. This territory stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States overnight. It opened up a vast new area for American settlement and exploration. Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on an expedition to explore this new territory and find a route to the Pacific Ocean. Their journey helped Americans learn about the geography, plants, animals, and Native American tribes of the West.

            <!-- Texas Annexation Section -->
            <h2>
                The Annexation of Texas
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Another important step in westward expansion was the annexation (or addition) of Texas to the United States. In the 1820s, American settlers began moving to Texas, which was then part of Mexico. These settlers eventually rebelled against Mexican rule and declared Texas an independent republic in 1836 after winning the Texas Revolution.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For nine years, Texas remained an independent country, but many Texans wanted to join the United States. In 1845, the United States annexed Texas, making it the 28th state. This annexation angered Mexico, which had never recognized Texas independence, and led to tensions between the United States and Mexico.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Mexican-American War Section -->
            <h2>
                The Mexican-American War
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The annexation of Texas was one of the causes of the Mexican-American War, which began in 1846. Another cause was a dispute over the southern border of Texas. The United States claimed the Rio Grande as the border, while Mexico said the border was the Nueces River, further north.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The war lasted until 1848 and ended with an American victory. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico gave up a huge area of land to the United States. This Mexican Cession included what are now the states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, and parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. The United States paid Mexico $15 million for this land.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this new territory, the United States now stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, fulfilling a major goal of Manifest Destiny. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 led to a rush of settlers to the new western territories.

            <!-- Homestead Act Section -->
            <h2>
                The Homestead Act
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                To encourage settlement of these western lands, the United States government passed the Homestead Act in 1862. This law allowed any adult citizen, or anyone who intended to become a citizen, to claim 160 acres of government land. If the settler lived on the land for five years and improved it by building a home and farming, they would own the land for free.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Homestead Act led to a massive migration of people to the West. Millions of Americans and immigrants took advantage of this opportunity to own land. They built farms, ranches, and new communities across the western territories. This settlement helped transform the West and led to the creation of new states.

                Impact on Native Americans
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                While westward expansion fulfilled the vision of Manifest Destiny for many Americans, it had devastating consequences for Native American tribes who had lived on these lands for thousands of years. As white settlers moved west, they took over lands that Native Americans had traditionally used for hunting, farming, and living.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States government often forced Native American tribes to sign treaties giving up their lands and move to reservations, which were specific areas set aside for Native Americans. Many tribes resisted these efforts to take their lands, leading to conflicts and wars. The U.S. Army was used to force tribes onto reservations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This period of westward expansion dramatically changed the way of life for Native American tribes. Many lost their traditional lands, their freedom to move and hunt as they had before, and many aspects of their cultures were threatened.
            </p>

            <h2>
                The Legacy of Westward Expansion
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Westward expansion and the idea of Manifest Destiny had a profound impact on the United States. In just a few decades, the country grew from a nation along the Atlantic coast to one that spanned the continent. New states were added, natural resources were discovered, and millions of people moved west to start new lives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, this expansion came at a great cost to Native American peoples and their cultures. The belief in Manifest Destiny justified taking lands that had been home to Native tribes for generations. This complex legacy of growth and displacement continues to shape American history and identity today.
