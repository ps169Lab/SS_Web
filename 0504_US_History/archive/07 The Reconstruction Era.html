                What Was Reconstruction?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The Reconstruction Era was the period following the American Civil War, from 1865 to 1877. During this time, the United States government worked to rebuild the South, bring the former Confederate states back into the Union, and determine the status of freed slaves. It was a time of significant change and challenges as the country tried to heal from the devastating effects of the war.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reconstruction was a complex process that involved political, social, and economic changes. The federal government imposed certain requirements on the southern states before they could rejoin the Union. These requirements included accepting the abolition of slavery, swearing loyalty to the United States, and adopting new state constitutions that guaranteed equal rights to all citizens, including former slaves.
            </p>

                Reconstruction Policies
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                After the Civil War ended in 1865, there were different ideas about how to handle Reconstruction. President Abraham Lincoln had planned a fairly lenient approach, but after his assassination, the process became more complicated. His successor, President Andrew Johnson, also favored a lenient policy toward the South, but he faced opposition from Congress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Republican-controlled Congress wanted stricter policies for the southern states. They passed several important laws and constitutional amendments during this period:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The 13th Amendment (1865): Abolished slavery throughout the United States.</li>
                <li>The 14th Amendment (1868): Granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the United States, including former slaves, and guaranteed equal protection under the law.</li>
                <li>The 15th Amendment (1870): Prohibited denying a citizen the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</li>
                <li>The Reconstruction Acts (1867): Divided the South into five military districts, each governed by a Union general, and set requirements for southern states to be readmitted to the Union.</li>
                <li>The Freedmen's Bureau Acts: Created an agency to provide food, housing, education, and medical care to former slaves and poor whites in the South.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                These policies were designed to protect the rights of freed slaves and ensure that the southern states would not return to their pre-war ways. They represented a significant expansion of federal power over the states.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Military Occupation Section -->
            <h2>
                Military Occupation of the South
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                One of the most controversial aspects of Reconstruction was the military occupation of the South. Under the Reconstruction Acts, the former Confederate states (except Tennessee, which had already been readmitted to the Union) were divided into five military districts. Each district was controlled by a Union general who had the power to appoint and remove state officials, supervise elections, and maintain order.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The military presence was necessary to enforce the new laws and protect the rights of freed slaves. Many white southerners resented this occupation, seeing it as an invasion of their states by a conquering army. However, for many freed slaves, the presence of Union soldiers provided essential protection against violence and discrimination.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The military occupation was not permanent. As each southern state met the requirements set by Congress—including ratifying the 14th Amendment and creating new state constitutions that guaranteed equal rights—they were readmitted to the Union and military rule was ended. By 1870, all the former Confederate states had been readmitted, though troops remained in some areas to maintain order.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Changes for Freed Slaves
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Reconstruction brought significant changes for the approximately 4 million people who had been enslaved before the Civil War. The most important change was freedom itself—the right to control their own lives, move freely, marry legally, and keep their families together. Former slaves (often called freedmen) also gained citizenship and, for men, the right to vote.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many freedmen sought education, which had been denied to them during slavery. The Freedmen's Bureau and northern charitable organizations established schools throughout the South. By 1870, about 4,000 schools for freedmen had been established, and literacy rates among African Americans began to rise.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Freedmen also participated in politics for the first time. They voted, held political meetings, and even served in public office. During Reconstruction, more than 600 African Americans were elected to state legislatures, and 16 served in the U.S. Congress. This political participation was unprecedented and represented a dramatic change from the pre-war South.
            </p>

                Resistance to Reconstruction
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Many white southerners strongly resisted the changes brought by Reconstruction. They opposed equal rights for African Americans and resented the presence of northern officials and troops in their states. This resistance took various forms, from political opposition to violence.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secret organizations like the Ku Klux Klan used violence and intimidation to prevent African Americans from exercising their new rights. They attacked and killed black voters, politicians, and community leaders, as well as white Republicans who supported Reconstruction. Congress passed laws to suppress this violence, but enforcement was difficult.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As northern support for Reconstruction declined in the 1870s, white Democrats (often called "Redeemers") gradually regained control of southern state governments. They passed laws that restricted the rights of African Americans and established racial segregation. By the time Reconstruction officially ended in 1877, much of the progress toward equal rights had been reversed.
            </p>

                The End of Reconstruction

            <p>
                Reconstruction officially ended in 1877 following the disputed presidential election of 1876. Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was declared the winner over Democrat Samuel Tilden in a compromise that included an agreement to withdraw the remaining federal troops from the South.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the end of federal oversight, southern states were free to implement policies that undermined the civil rights of African Americans. They passed laws known as "Jim Crow" laws that enforced racial segregation and restricted voting rights through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other measures. These laws effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and created a system of legal segregation that would last until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

                The Legacy of Reconstruction
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Reconstruction was a complex period with mixed results. On one hand, it failed to secure lasting political and civil rights for African Americans in the South. The promise of equality was largely unfulfilled as white supremacy was reestablished in the southern states.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, Reconstruction left an important constitutional legacy. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments established principles of equality and civil rights that, though not fully realized at the time, provided a legal foundation for the Civil Rights Movement nearly a century later. The period also saw the first significant participation of African Americans in American democracy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reconstruction represented an ambitious attempt to transform American society after the Civil War. While it ultimately fell short of its most idealistic goals, it set important precedents and established principles that continue to shape American society today.
