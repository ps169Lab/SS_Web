The Civil War was a very sad and important time in American history. It was a big fight between the North and the South that lasted from 1861 to 1865. It was the deadliest war in American history, and it changed the country forever.

There were many reasons why the Civil War started, but one of the biggest was slavery. The South depended on slaves to work on their farms, especially to grow cotton. But many people in the North thought slavery was wrong and wanted to end it. This made the North and South very angry with each other.

Another reason was about states' rights. The South thought that each state should be able to make its own rules, even if it meant allowing slavery. The North thought that the federal government should have more power to make laws for the whole country. This disagreement about who should have more power also led to the war.

The North and South also had different economies. The South was mostly farms, while the North had more factories and businesses. They had different ideas about what was important for the country.

Abraham Lincoln became president in 1860. He didn't want slavery to spread to new states. This made the South very worried, and some states decided to leave the United States and form their own country called the Confederate States of America.

The war started when the South attacked a fort called Fort Sumter. Lincoln asked for soldiers to fight the South and bring the country back together. Many battles were fought, and many people died. Some important battles were the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Vicksburg.

Finally, in 1865, the South surrendered. The Civil War ended slavery, made the United States stronger, and showed that states couldn't just leave the country whenever they wanted. But it also left the South in ruins and created many problems that the country had to deal with for many years to come. It was a difficult time, but it helped make America what it is today.
