                How new taxes after the French and Indian War led to revolution.</p><h2>How the British Colonies became America</h2><div><p>As we learned, the country of Britiain came to America and made a colony here. For a long time, the British people lived here under the rule of the British King. But then things started to change. The British people decided that they didn't want the kind to be in charge of them anymore. So they fought against the British King to make their own country. This fight was called the American Revolution. </p><p>A Revolution is when people fight a war against their own government. When the British peole fought against the British King, they wanted their own government. They fought this war and won. That is how America first started.</p> </div>

                The French and Indian War</h2><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/French_and_indian_war_map.svg/1200px-French_and_indian_war_map.svg.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
            
            <p>Before the American Revolution, the British and the colonists fought a war against the French and Indians. It was called the <b>French and Indian War</b>, and it lasted from 1754 to 1763. Great Britain won, and they took over all of the land that the French had been using. But there was a problem -  the war cost a lot of money. The British leaders thought the colonists should help pay for the war because it was fought partly to protect them. So they started to charge them new taxes. This was where the trouble started. </p><p><img src="https://org-dcmp-staticassets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/posterimages/20385_1.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

            <h2>
                New Taxes on the Colonies
            </h2><p>There were a lot of new taxes on the colonists. The taxes made things more expensive, and this made many (but not all of ) the colonists upset. One was the Sugar Act in 1764, which taxed things like sugar, coffee, and wine that the colonists bought from other countries. Another was the Stamp Act in 1765, which made people pay for a special stamp on newspapers, legal papers, and even playing cards!</p>
        
            <ul><li>The Sugar Act (1764): This put a tax on sugar, coffee, wine, and other imported goods.</li>
                <li>The Stamp Act (1765): This required colonists to pay for a stamp on all printed materials like newspapers, legal documents, and playing cards.</li>
                <li>The Townshend Acts (1767): These placed taxes on items like glass, paint, oil, lead, paper, and tea.</li>
                <li>The Tea Act (1773): This rule said that the colonists could only buy tea from one company instead of from whomever they wanted. </li>
            </ul><div><img src="https://www.battlefields.org/sites/default/files/styles/resource_hero/public/thumbnails/image/colonist-American-concern-colonies-tea-tax-proclamation-1767%20Landscape.jpg?h=4537bda6&amp;itok=tNYXwSuv" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></div>
            
            <p>The colonists were angry because they didn't have anyone to speak for them in the British government. They didn't get to vote for the people who made the tax laws. They said, <b>"No taxation without representation!"</b> This meant they didn't want to pay taxes if they didn't have a say in how the government was run and what the laws were.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imagesofoldhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/No-taxation.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>

                Colonial Protests
            </h2>
        
            <p>The colonists protested by not buying British goods. This is called a boycott. They wanted to hurt the British economy so they would listen to their complaints. Some people formed groups like the Sons of Liberty to stand up to the British. They organized protests and sometimes even used violence to scare British officials.</p><p><img src="https://bri-wp-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/BRI_APUSH_03_03_BostonTea.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>One famous protest was the Boston Tea Party in 1773. A group of colonists dressed up as Native Americans, snuck onto British ships in Boston Harbor, and dumped chests of British tea into the water! This was a big act of defiance against the Tea Act, which gave a British company a monopoly on selling tea in America.</p>

            <p>The Boston Tea Party cost the British Tea Company a lot of money and this made the British Government upset. They started to make new rules called the Intolerable Acts in 1774. They closed Boston Harbor and they said they wouldn't open it again until the colonists paid for all of the tea they dumped. They also gave the British more control over Massachusetts (where the Boston Tea Party was) and made the colonists house and feed British soldiers in their homes.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/73/163173-050-E00D6CF1/ships-British-Boston-Harbor-1774-intolerable-acts.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
            
            <p>These new rules made the colonists even more determined to fight for their freedom. They had a meeting and made a group called the First Continental Congress to talk about what to do. They started to get ready for a possible war.</p><p><img src="https://www.battlefields.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_large/public/Stand-Your-Ground-By-Don-Troiani.jpg?h=016726c1&amp;itok=TKNYinqN" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
