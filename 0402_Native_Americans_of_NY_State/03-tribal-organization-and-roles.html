            <h2>Two Different Ways to Lead</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">New York's Native Americans had two main groups - the Iroquois and Algonquian peoples. Both needed leaders, but organized their governments very differently. Geography shaped these differences. The Iroquois lived in flatter areas with rich soil perfect for farming, allowing them to stay in one place and create a union of tribes working together. The Algonquian lived in mountainous regions where farming was harder, so they kept villages independent and moved with the seasons to hunt and fish.</span>

            <h2>How the Iroquois Made Decisions</h2>

            <h3>The Great Council</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Around 1570, five Iroquois tribes - the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca - formed the Iroquois Confederacy. Later the Tuscarora joined, making six nations. Each tribe chose leaders called sachems who met in a Great Council to make big decisions about war, peace, and trade. They followed rules called the Great Law of Peace. This was one of North America's first democracies.</span>

            <h3>Clan Mothers Choose Leaders</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Iroquois women had great power. Elder women called Clan Mothers chose which men became sachems. The position was hereditary, passing through families, but Clan Mothers had final say. If a sachem did poorly, Clan Mothers could remove him - called "knocking off the horns" because chiefs wore deer antlers. Iroquois clans were matrilineal, meaning family membership passed through mothers. This gave women strong voices in government.</span>

            <h3>Special Jobs</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Iroquois had Medicine Societies - groups of healers. The False Face Society wore scary wooden masks to frighten away bad spirits causing disease. While masked members were men, the society leader was always a woman.</span>

            <h2>How the Algonquian Made Decisions</h2>

            <h3>Independent Village Chiefs</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Unlike the Iroquois, each Algonquian village was independent. Villages had a few hundred people from clan families. Each village had its own chief called an ogima, chosen by the village council. The chief made decisions about hunting, fishing, and when to move. Because the mountainous land made farming difficult, Algonquian villages moved with the seasons to follow food - near the coast in summer to fish, inland in winter to hunt. This mobile lifestyle meant villages stayed independent rather than forming large confederacies.</span>

            <h3>Special Jobs</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Algonquian villages had shamans - spiritual leaders and healers who connected people to the spirit world. Shamans were so important that even chiefs asked their approval before big plans. Villages also had skilled artisans like potters who made beautiful decorated pots for cooking and trading.</span>

            <h2>Understanding Tribal Organization</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Think of these tribes like a school. Clan Mothers were like principals choosing staff. Chiefs were like student councils making rules. Shamans and medicine societies were like nurses helping people feel better. Artisans were like art teachers creating beautiful things. Each person had a special job keeping the tribe running smoothly. The Iroquois created a large government where six nations worked together because their farming lifestyle kept them in permanent villages. The Algonquian kept villages independent because their hunting and fishing lifestyle required moving with the seasons. Both systems worked perfectly for their different lands and ways of life.</span>
