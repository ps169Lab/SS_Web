            <h2>Iroquois Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                Iroquois families lived in amazing buildings called longhouses. These were huge wooden structures covered with bark that could be over 100 feet long - longer than a basketball court! A single longhouse could hold 10 to 20 families from the same clan, all living together like one big extended family.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inside a longhouse, there was a long hallway down the middle with family areas on both sides. Each family had their own space separated by bark walls or animal skins. Cooking fires were shared between families, and smoke escaped through holes in the roof. At night, families slept on raised platforms covered with furs and blankets.
            </p>

            <h2>Algonquian Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                Algonquian families lived differently depending on the season. In summer, they built small, dome-shaped houses called wigwams that could hold one family. These were made from wooden poles covered with bark or animal skins and had a door made of buckskin.
            </p>

            <p>
                In winter, Algonquian families built larger, stronger longhouses where several families could stay warm together. When spring came, they would often move to new locations to follow the best hunting and fishing spots.
            </p>

            <h2>Jobs for Men and Women</h2>
            
            <h3>Women's Work</h3>
            
            <p>
                Native American women had very important jobs. Iroquois women were the farmers who grew the "Three Sisters" - corn, beans, and squash. They planted the seeds, tended the crops, and harvested the food. Women also cooked meals, made clothing from animal skins, and took care of children.
            </p>

            <p>
                Algonquian women gathered wild plants, berries, and nuts. They were famous for weaving beautiful, strong baskets used to carry and store food. Women also made pottery and sewed warm clothes from animal furs.
            </p>

            <h3>Men's Work</h3>
            
            <p>
                Men were the hunters and fishermen. They used bows and arrows, spears, and traps to catch deer, bear, turkey, beaver, and other animals. Iroquois men also cleared land for farming and built the longhouses and village fences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Algonquian men were skilled at making birchbark canoes for traveling on rivers and lakes. They also used slash-and-burn methods to clear forest land for farming, cutting down trees and burning them to make fertile soil.
            </p>

            <h2>Children and Education</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native American children learned by watching and helping adults. Boys learned to hunt and fish by going with their fathers and uncles. Girls learned farming, cooking, and crafts by working alongside their mothers and aunts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Children also learned through stories told by elders. These stories taught them about their history, values, and how to behave properly in their community. Storytelling usually happened in winter when there was more time to sit around the fire.
            </p>

            <h2>Games and Fun</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native Americans invented lacrosse, which they called different names in their languages. This game was much more than just fun - it was used to honor spirits, settle disagreements between tribes, and even cure illnesses. Games could involve hundreds of players and last for days!
            </p>

            <p>
                In winter, the Iroquois played a game called Snowsnake, where players slid long wooden sticks along trenches in the snow to see whose would go the farthest. Children also played with dolls, toys, and games that helped them practice adult skills.
            </p>

            <h2>Following the Seasons</h2>
            
            <p>
                Daily life changed with the seasons. Spring meant planting crops and fishing for spawning fish. Summer was for tending gardens and gathering berries. Fall brought harvest time and hunting season. Winter was for storytelling, making crafts, and living off stored food.
            </p>

            <p>
                This seasonal way of life taught Native Americans to work with nature's rhythms and make sure they had everything they needed throughout the year.
