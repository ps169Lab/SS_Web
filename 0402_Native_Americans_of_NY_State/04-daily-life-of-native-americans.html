            <h2>Iroquois Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Iroquois families lived in amazing buildings called longhouses. These were huge wooden structures covered with bark that could be over 100 feet long - longer than a basketball court! A single longhouse could hold 10 to 20 families from the same clan, all living together like one big extended family.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Inside a longhouse, there was a long hallway down the middle with family areas on both sides. Each family had their own space separated by bark walls or animal skins. Cooking fires were shared between families, and smoke escaped through holes in the roof. At night, families slept on raised platforms covered with furs and blankets.</span>

            <h2>Algonquian Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Algonquian families lived differently depending on the season. In summer, they built small, dome-shaped houses called wigwams that could hold one family. These were made from wooden poles covered with bark or animal skins and had a door made of buckskin.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">In winter, Algonquian families built larger, stronger longhouses where several families could stay warm together. When spring came, they would often move to new locations to follow the best hunting and fishing spots.</span>
