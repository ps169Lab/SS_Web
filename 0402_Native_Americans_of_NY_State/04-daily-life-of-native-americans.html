            <h2>Iroquois Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Iroquois families lived in amazing buildings called longhouses. These were huge wooden structures covered with bark that could be over 100 feet long - longer than a basketball court! A single longhouse could hold 10 to 20 families from the same clan, all living together like one big extended family. Because the Iroquois lived in flat areas with rich soil perfect for farming, they could stay in one place year-round, making it worthwhile to build these large, permanent homes.</span>

The Iroquois had good farming land, so they stayed in one place all year and built big, permanent homes.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Inside a longhouse, there was a long hallway down the middle with family areas on both sides. Each family had their own space separated by bark walls or animal skins. Cooking fires were shared between families, and smoke escaped through holes in the roof. At night, families slept on raised platforms covered with furs and blankets.</span>

            <h2>Algonquian Family Life</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Algonquian families lived differently depending on the season. Because they lived in mountainous areas where the soil was poor for farming, they had to move throughout the year to hunt and fish. In summer, they built small, dome-shaped houses called wigwams that could hold one family. These were made from wooden poles covered with bark or animal skins and had a door made of buckskin.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In winter, Algonquian families built larger, stronger longhouses where several families could stay warm together. When spring came, they would move to new locations to follow the best hunting and fishing spots. This mobile lifestyle was necessary because their land couldn't support year-round farming.</span>

            <h2>Jobs for Men and Women</h2>
            
            <h3>Women's Work</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Native American women had very important jobs. Iroquois women were the farmers who grew the "Three Sisters" - corn, beans, and squash. They planted the seeds, tended the crops, and harvested the food. Women also cooked meals, made clothing from animal skins, and took care of children.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Algonquian women gathered wild plants, berries, and nuts. They were famous for weaving beautiful, strong baskets used to carry and store food. Women also made pottery and sewed warm clothes from animal furs.</span>

            <h3>Men's Work</h3>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Men were the hunters and fishermen. They used bows and arrows, spears, and traps to catch deer, bear, turkey, beaver, and other animals. Iroquois men also cleared land for farming and built the longhouses and village fences.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Algonquian men were skilled at making birchbark canoes for traveling on rivers and lakes - essential for their mobile lifestyle in mountainous terrain. They also used slash-and-burn methods to clear forest land for small gardens, cutting down trees and burning them to make fertile soil, though hunting and fishing remained more important than farming in their rocky landscape.</span>

            <h2>Children and Education</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Native American children learned by watching and helping adults. Boys learned to hunt and fish by going with their fathers and uncles. Girls learned farming, cooking, and crafts by working alongside their mothers and aunts.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Children also learned through stories told by elders. These stories taught them about their history, values, and how to behave properly in their community. Storytelling usually happened in winter when there was more time to sit around the fire.</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Native Americans invented lacrosse, which they called different names in their languages. This game was much more than just fun - it was used to honor spirits, settle disagreements between tribes, and even cure illnesses. Games could involve hundreds of players and last for days!</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In winter, the Iroquois played a game called Snowsnake, where players slid long wooden sticks along trenches in the snow to see whose would go the farthest. Children also played with dolls, toys, and games that helped them practice adult skills.</span>

            <h2>Following the Seasons</h2>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Daily life changed with the seasons. Spring meant planting crops and fishing for spawning fish. Summer was for tending gardens and gathering berries. Fall brought harvest time and hunting season. Winter was for storytelling, making crafts, and living off stored food. The Iroquois followed these rhythms from their permanent villages, while the Algonquian moved their entire communities to different locations.</span>

                <span class="standard-reading">This seasonal way of life taught Native Americans to work with nature's rhythms and make sure they had everything they needed throughout the year. Geography shaped how each group adapted - the Iroquois' flat, fertile land allowed farming-based stability, while the Algonquian's mountainous terrain required hunting-based mobility.</span>
