                Welcome to Native American History!
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Long before European explorers arrived in America, Native American peoples had been living in what is now New York State for thousands of years. These indigenous peoples created rich cultures, built thriving communities, and developed sophisticated ways of living that were perfectly adapted to the Northeast Woodlands environment.

            <p>
                The Native Americans of New York State were not just one group, but many different tribes with their own languages, customs, and ways of life. The two main groups were the Iroquois (who called themselves the Haudenosaunee, meaning "People of the Longhouse") and the Algonquian-speaking peoples who lived along the coast and rivers.

            <p>
                These peoples were skilled farmers, hunters, and craftspeople. They created one of the world's first democratic governments, invented the sport of lacrosse, and developed sustainable ways of living that allowed them to thrive for thousands of years.
