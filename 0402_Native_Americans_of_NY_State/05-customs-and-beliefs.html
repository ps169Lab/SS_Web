            <h2>Spiritual Beliefs</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native Americans in New York had deep spiritual beliefs that guided their daily lives. Both the Iroquois and Algonquian peoples believed in a Great Spirit who created all living things - people, animals, plants, rivers, and forests. They also believed in a Good Spirit and an Evil Spirit who were responsible for good and bad events on Earth.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the most important beliefs was that everything in nature had a spirit and deserved respect. Animals, trees, rocks, and streams were all considered to have souls. This belief helped Native Americans live in harmony with the natural world around them.
            </p>

            <h2>Dreams and Visions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Dreams were very important to Native Americans, especially the Iroquois. They believed that dreams were messages from the spirit world that showed what a person's soul wanted or needed. If someone had a powerful dream, the whole community would work together to help make that dream come true.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes dreams would tell people to join special healing societies or learn new skills. Medicine men and women often received their calling to heal others through dreams or visions.
            </p>

            <h2>Seasonal Ceremonies and Festivals</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native Americans held many ceremonies throughout the year that followed the seasons and farming cycle. The Iroquois celebrated festivals like the Maple Sugar Festival in early spring, the Corn Planting Festival, the Strawberry Festival in early summer, the Green Corn Festival, and the Harvest Festival in fall.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most important ceremony was the Mid-Winter Festival, also called the New Year's Festival. This celebration included dream sharing, thanksgiving prayers, and special rituals to prepare for the coming year. These festivals brought the whole community together to give thanks and ask for blessings.
            </p>

            <h2>The False Face Society</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Iroquois had a special healing group called the False Face Society. Members of this society wore wooden masks carved from living trees. They believed these masks had the power to scare away evil spirits that caused sickness and disease.
            </p>

            <p>
                The masks had twisted, scary faces and were painted red or black. Members would perform healing ceremonies by shaking rattles, chanting, and using the masks to drive away illness. People joined this society after being healed by them or having a special dream.
            </p>

            <h2>Wampum - More Than Money</h2>
            
            <p>
                Wampum were special beads made from purple and white clam shells. While Europeans thought of wampum as money, it meant much more to Native Americans. Wampum belts were used to record important events, treaties, and tribal stories.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most famous wampum belt was the Hiawatha belt, which showed the unity of the five Iroquois nations. Making wampum was very difficult because the shells were hard to drill without breaking, which made these beads very valuable and meaningful.
            </p>

            <h2>Storytelling Traditions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native Americans passed down their history, values, and beliefs through storytelling. Special storytellers called Hage'ota memorized hundreds of traditional stories and shared them with the community, especially during the long winter months.
            </p>

            <p>
                These stories taught children how to behave, explained how the world was created, and preserved the tribe's history. One famous story told how the world was created on the back of a great turtle, which is why North America is sometimes called "Turtle Island."
            </p>

            <h2>Connection to Animals</h2>
            
            <p>
                Native Americans felt a special connection to animals. Many clans were named after animals like Bear, Wolf, Turtle, or Hawk. They believed these animals were their spiritual guides and protectors.
            </p>

            <p>
                When hunting, Native Americans would thank the animal's spirit and use every part of the animal to show respect. They believed that if they treated animals with honor, the animals would continue to provide for their families.
            </p>

            <h2>Living Traditions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Many of these customs and beliefs continue today among Native American communities in New York. They help connect modern Native Americans to their ancestors and maintain their cultural identity for future generations.
