                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Animism:</strong> The belief that all things in nature (trees, rivers, animals) have a
                        spirit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> A "Big Idea" where you give back to nature whenever you take
                        something.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Tradition:</strong> Passing down history through spoken stories instead of books.

            <h2>The Spirit in All Things</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In the forests of the Northeast, Native Americans practiced
                    <strong>Animism</strong>. They believed that a Great Spirit created the world, but they also
                    believed that every tree, rock, and river had its own soul. This meant the world was a very
                    "crowded" place full of spirits that deserved respect.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Native Americans in the East believed that everything has a spirit. Trees,
                    rocks, and rivers all had souls. This is called Animism.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="image-container"><img class="reading-image"
                    src="https://e8adnuaw3us.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/elements-of-many-native-american-origin-stories.webp?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1"
                    alt="Spirits in nature" /></p>

            <h2>Reciprocity: Giving and Taking</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Because nature was alive with spirits, Native Americans followed the rule
                    of <strong>Reciprocity</strong>. When a hunter in the North took a deer to feed his family, he would
                    offer a prayer of thanks to the deer’s spirit. When a farmer in the South planted corn, she held a
                    festival to thank the "Three Sisters" spirits. They believed that if you did not give back, the
                    spirits would stop providing food.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Native Americans followed a rule: if you take something from nature, you must
                    say thank you. Hunters prayed after a hunt. Farmers danced to thank the corn spirits.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Dreams and Stories</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Dreams were seen as special messages. The Iroquois believed dreams told
                    you what your soul needed to be healthy. They also used <strong>Oral Tradition</strong> to tell the
                    story of "Turtle Island"—the belief that the world was built on the back of a giant turtle. These
                    stories and dreams helped the community stay connected to the spirit world.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Dreams were very important messages. Stories like "Turtle Island" taught
                    children how the world began. These stories were told out loud for hundreds of years.</span>

            <h2>Special Traditions</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">To keep the community healthy and strong, the people had special tools.
                    They used <strong>Wampum</strong> (shell beads) to record their laws and promises. They also had a
                    healing group called the <strong>False Face Society</strong> that used wooden masks to help the
                    sick. You will learn more about these "Expert Topics" on our next page!</span>
