            <h2>The False Face Society: Healing the Spirit</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The False Face Society was a secret group of healers. When an Iroquois person felt sick or had a bad dream, they called upon this society for help. The most unique part of this tradition was how the masks were made: they were carved directly into the trunk of a <strong>living</strong> basswood tree!</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The False Face Society was a group of healers. They wore wooden masks. These masks were carved into the side of a living tree!</span>

            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Before carving, the artist would pray and offer tobacco to the tree's spirit. They believed the spirit of the tree stayed inside the mask to help fight away "evil spirits" that caused sickness. Once finished, the masks were painted red if they were started in the morning, or black if they were started in the afternoon.</span>

            <h2>Wampum: The Living Record</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">To the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), wampum was not money—it was a way to "write" without a pen. These beads were made from the purple and white shells of the quahog clam found in the East. By weaving these beads into specific patterns on belts, the tribes could record history, laws, and sacred promises called <strong>covenants</strong>.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Wampum are beads made from sea shells. They are purple and white. The beads were woven into belts to tell stories and keep laws.</span>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The most famous record is the <strong>Hiawatha Belt</strong>. It shows four squares and a central white pine tree connected by a line. This pattern records the Great Law of Peace, which joined five warring tribes into one peaceful group. When a leader spoke while holding a belt, it was a sign that they were telling the absolute truth.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The Hiawatha Belt is very famous. It shows five groups of people living in peace. Holding a wampum belt meant you were telling the truth.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Masks:</strong> Why do you think the Iroquois insisted on carving the masks into a <em>living</em> tree instead of just using a fallen log? How does this connect to our big idea of <strong>Animism</strong>?</li>
                <li><strong>The Wampum:</strong> If you had to design a wampum belt for our 4th-grade classroom, what symbols would you use to show our "laws" or "promises"?</li>
