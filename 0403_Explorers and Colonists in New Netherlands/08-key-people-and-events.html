            <h2>Peter Minuit - The First Governor</h2>
            
            <p>
                Peter Minuit was the first governor of New Amsterdam and is famous for buying Manhattan Island from Native Americans in 1626. He moved the colony from Fort Orange to Manhattan Island because Fort Orange often flooded and froze over, making it hard for ships to come and go. Manhattan had a protected harbor and was closer to the ocean, making it perfect for trading with Europe.

            <p>
                Minuit also started the Patroon System, where rich people could buy large amounts of land and become like mini-kings. Patroons had to bring at least 50 families to live and work on their land within four years. This system brought more people to New Netherland but created a small group of very powerful landowners.

            <h2>Willem Kieft and Kieft's War</h2>
            
            <p>
                Willem Kieft was a leader who tried to make Native Americans pay him money, which made them very angry. This led to Kieft's War in 1643, when Kieft wanted to punish Native Americans for something that happened long ago. During the two-year war, Native Americans attacked farms and villages, and Dutch settlers had to hide in Fort Amsterdam for safety. The war ended with a peace treaty, but it made Native Americans distrust the Dutch even more.
            </p>

            <h2>Adriaen Van Der Donck - The Lawyer Leader</h2>
            
            <p>
                Adriaen Van Der Donck was a lawyer and important leader who wrote the first book about the colony. He fought for settlers' rights and helped create a more fair government. When colonists got mad at Willem Kieft for starting the war with Native Americans, Van Der Donck organized them to get Kieft removed from power by the Dutch West India Company.
            </p>

            <h2>Peter Stuyvesant - The Last Director-General</h2>

            <p>
                Peter Stuyvesant ruled from 1647 to 1664 and made many improvements to New Amsterdam. He built a protective wall where Wall Street is today, cleaned up streets, and built new roads. However, Stuyvesant was very strict and wanted everyone to follow the same religion, which made some people angry. Because of his unpopularity and the colony's weak defenses, the English were able to take over New Amsterdam without a fight in 1664.
