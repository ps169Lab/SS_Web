                <h3>Expert Vocabulary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Navigator:</strong> A person who directs the route or course of a ship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Claim:</strong> To state that a piece of land belongs to a specific country.</li>
                    <li><strong>Northwest Passage:</strong> A mythical water route through North America to Asia.</li>

            <h2>The Mystery of the Northwest Passage</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">During the Age of Exploration, European kings and queens were desperate to find the <strong>Northwest Passage</strong>. At the time, traveling to Asia to get silk and spices took months because ships had to sail all the way around the tip of Africa. Explorers believed there was a secret water route hidden somewhere in the north that would let them sail straight through the American continent. They didn't realize yet that the Americas were thousands of miles wide with no easy way through!</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Explorers wanted to find a shortcut to Asia. This was called the <strong>Northwest Passage</strong>. Traveling to Asia took a very long time. They hoped a secret river would let them sail through North America. They did not know the land was too big to sail across.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>Henry Hudson and the Half Moon</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">In 1609, an English navigator named <strong>Henry Hudson</strong> sailed his ship, the <em>Half Moon</em>, into New York Harbor. He was working for the Netherlands. He was certain the Hudson River was the Northwest Passage he had been looking for. He sailed all the way up to where Albany is today before the water became too shallow. Even though he didn't find a shortcut to Asia, he claimed the land for the Dutch, which led to the start of the fur trade.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Henry Hudson was a sailor. He worked for the Dutch. In 1609, he sailed his ship into New York. He thought the Hudson River was the shortcut to Asia. He sailed as far as Albany. He did not find the shortcut, but he claimed the land for the Dutch anyway.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>Champlain, Verrazano, and Block</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">While Hudson explored the south, <strong>Samuel de Champlain</strong> was exploring the north for France. He reached a massive lake (now Lake Champlain) in the same year Hudson arrived! Earlier, in 1524, <strong>Giovanni da Verrazano</strong> sailed for France and became the first European to enter New York Harbor. Later, <strong>Adrien Block</strong> explored Long Island Sound and made the first maps that showed Manhattan was an island.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Other men explored New York, too. Samuel de Champlain explored the north for France. Giovanni da Verrazano was the first European to see New York Harbor. Adrien Block made maps of Long Island. They all wanted to find new land for their kings and queens.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Shortcut:</strong> If you were Henry Hudson and realized the river was getting smaller and shallower, at what point would you turn around? How would you explain to the Dutch King that you didn't find the Northwest Passage?</li>
                <li><strong>The Maps:</strong> Looking at their routes, which of these four explorers would you have wanted to sail with? Think about the 3 G's—which one would be your personal motivation?</li>
