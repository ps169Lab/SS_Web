            <h2>Why Leave Home?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Starting in the 1400s, European countries began a period known as the <strong>Age of Exploration</strong>. Navigators were sent out on long, dangerous journeys across the ocean. Why did they go? It wasn't just for fun or adventure. Historians use three words starting with the letter "G" to explain their motivations: <strong>Gold, God, and Glory</strong>. These three things convinced monarchs to spend a lot of money on ships and sailors.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Long ago, people from Europe began to sail across the ocean. This was called the <strong>Age of Exploration</strong>. It was very dangerous. They went for three main reasons. These reasons all start with the letter G: <strong>Gold, God, and Glory</strong>. These words help us understand why they left home.</span>
            </p>

            

            <h2>Gold: The Quest for Riches</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The first "G" stands for <strong>Gold</strong>. Explorers wanted to find actual gold and silver, but they were also looking for "liquid gold"—expensive spices like cinnamon and pepper. These items were worth a fortune in Europe. By finding new trade routes, countries hoped to become the wealthiest and most powerful in the world.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The first G is for <strong>Gold</strong>. Explorers wanted to find treasure and spices. Spices were worth a lot of money. If a country found more gold, it would become very rich and powerful.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>God: Spreading Faith</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The second "G" stands for <strong>God</strong>. Many European leaders believed it was their duty to spread their religious beliefs to other parts of the world. They sent priests on ships to build missions and teach their faith to the people they met in new lands. For them, exploration was a religious mission.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The second G is for <strong>God</strong>. Kings and queens wanted to spread their religion. They sent priests on ships. They wanted to teach their faith to people in new lands.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Glory: The Race for Fame</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The final "G" stands for <strong>Glory</strong>. This was about competition and fame. Explorers wanted to be the first to "discover" a place and have their names written in history books. Monarchs wanted glory, too. They wanted to claim as much land as possible to build a massive empire. The more land a country owned, the more "glory" they had.</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">The third G is for <strong>Glory</strong>. Explorers wanted to be famous. They wanted everyone to know their names. Kings and queens wanted to own a lot of land. Having more land made them more famous and important than other kings.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Choice:</strong> If you were an explorer, which of the 3 G's would be your biggest reason for sailing into the unknown? Why?</li>
