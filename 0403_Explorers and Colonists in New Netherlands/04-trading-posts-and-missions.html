        <h2>The "Brown Gold" of New York</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="standard-reading">Long before New York had skyscrapers, it had something even more valuable to Europeans: the <strong>North American Beaver</strong>. In the 1600s, beaver fur was the height of fashion in Europe because it was used to make expensive, waterproof felt hats. Since beavers were almost gone in Europe, explorers were excited to find millions of them in New York’s rivers.</span>
            <span class="easy-reading">Long ago, New York had many beavers. People in Europe wanted beaver fur to make fancy hats. There were not many beavers left in Europe. Explorers were happy to find so many beavers in New York.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/great-beaver-wars-facts.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

        

        <h2>Trading Posts and Forts</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="standard-reading">To make money from this "brown gold," the Dutch and French built <strong>trading posts</strong>. These were small stores near rivers where European traders met Native Americans to barter items like metal pots and tools for beaver pelts. Because these furs were worth a lot of money, settlers built <strong>forts</strong> with high wooden walls, like Fort Orange, to keep their goods safe.</span>
            <span class="easy-reading">Settlers built <strong>trading posts</strong> near rivers. These were like small stores. They traded tools for beaver skins. The furs were worth a lot of money. Settlers built <strong>forts</strong> with big wooden walls to keep the furs safe.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://nysm.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/fort-orange-and-the-patroons-house-workingfile.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Trading_post_Bathrust_%28Gambia%29_1900.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>

        

        <h2>Missions and New Homes</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="standard-reading">While the Dutch were focused on the business of the fur trade, French explorers in Northern New York also built <strong>missions</strong>. These were religious settlements where priests lived and worked among the Native people. Whether they came for money or for faith, the "fur fever" for beavers is the main reason the first permanent settlements were built in our state.</span>
            <span class="easy-reading">Some people came to New York for business. Others came for their religion. They built <strong>missions</strong> to live and pray. The beaver trade is the main reason people first started building homes in New York.</span></p><p></p><p><img src="https://www.legendsofamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jesuit-missionary.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p><img src="https://www.legendsofamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fortamsterdam.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p><p></p>
