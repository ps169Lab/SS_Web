            <h2>A Floating Neighborhood</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Imagine spending two months inside a wooden box that never stops moving. That was life on a ship like the <em>Half Moon</em>. Ships were packed with sailors, soldiers, and families looking for a new life. There were no private bedrooms; most people slept in hammocks or on the hard wooden floor in the <strong>hull</strong>. It was dark, damp, and very crowded. Because the ships carried animals like cows and chickens for food, it was also very noisy and smelly!</span>
                <span class="easy-reading">Life on a ship was very hard. People lived in a wooden ship for two months. There were no real beds. Most people slept on the floor or in hammocks. It was crowded and dark. Ships also carried animals like cows and pigs. It was very loud and smelly inside!</span>

            <h2>Salt, Hardtack, and Survival</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">Since there were no refrigerators, food had to be preserved in salt. Sailors ate salted beef and a rock-hard cracker called <strong>hardtack</strong>. Hardtack was so tough that sailors often had to soak it in water or coffee just to take a bite! Sometimes, tiny bugs called weevils would crawl inside the crackers. Fresh water was also a problem; after a few weeks at sea, the water in the wooden barrels would turn green and slimy. This poor diet often led to a disease called <strong>scurvy</strong>.</span>

            <h2>Storms and Sea Monsters</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="standard-reading">The Atlantic Ocean is famous for its massive storms. When the waves grew high, the <strong>navigator</strong> would order everyone below deck to keep them from being washed overboard. Many children on these ships had never seen the ocean before and were terrified of the giant waves and the legends of sea monsters. However, the hope of finding "Glory" or starting a new home kept them going until they finally saw the coastline of New York.</span>

They were afraid of storms and sea monsters. But they stayed brave because they wanted a new home in New York.</span>

            <h2>Class Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Suitcase Challenge:</strong> If you were moving to New York on a ship and could only bring one small trunk, what 3 items would you pack to help you survive the two-month trip?</li>
                <li><strong>Hardtack vs. Pizza:</strong> Why do you think sailors were willing to eat "buggy" crackers and salty meat for months? Does this change how you think about the "Glory" they were searching for?</li>
